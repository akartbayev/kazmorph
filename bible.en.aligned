Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah.
the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:
and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah.
and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
but to Hannah he gave a double portion;
So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk.
Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh’s temple.
She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, and wept bitterly.
Don’t count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation.
When the time had come, Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked him of Yahweh.
Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you.
” So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.
Therefore also I have granted him to Yahweh.
He lifts up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory.
He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for no man shall prevail by strength.
Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces.
He will give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.
The child served Yahweh before Eli the priest.
and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith.
So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, “Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.
Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
” They went to their own home.
The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.
Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
He said to them, “Why do you do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.
No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make Yahweh’s people disobey.
If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Yahweh, who shall entreat for him?” Notwithstanding, they didn’t listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh intended to kill them.
The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.
Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? Did I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?
Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?’
“Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever.
’ But now Yahweh says, ‘Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
The man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall consume your eyes, and grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.
“‘This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall both die.
I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever.
Yahweh’s word was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.
and the lamp of God hadn’t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down in Yahweh’s temple, where the ark of God was;
Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, “Here I am.
He ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.
” He went and lay down.
Now Samuel didn’t yet know Yahweh, neither was Yahweh’s word yet revealed to him.
Yahweh called Samuel again the third time.
He arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.
” Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.
Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” Then Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant hears.
Yahweh said to Samuel, “Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.
In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.
Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be removed with sacrifice nor offering forever.
Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of Yahweh’s house.
Then Eli called Samuel, and said, “Samuel, my son!” He said, “Here I am.
He said, “What is the thing that he has spoken to you? Please don’t hide it from me.
God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you.
Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.
Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by Yahweh’s word.
The word of Samuel came to all Israel.
Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
When the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines? Let us get the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.
When the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
The Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.
Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.
Be strong, and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you.
The ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
There ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with earth on his head.
When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, “What does the noise of this tumult mean?” The man hurried, and came and told Eli.
Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.
” He said, “How did the matter go, my son?”
He who brought the news answered, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people.
Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.
He had judged Israel forty years.
His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to be delivered.
” But she didn’t answer, neither did she regard it.
She said, “The glory has departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.
The Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
When they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before Yahweh’s ark.
When they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before Yahweh’s ark; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold.
Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day.
When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us; for his hand is severe on us, and on Dagon our god.
” They carried the ark of the God of Israel there.
So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.
They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people.
” For there was a deadly confusion throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
The men who didn’t die were struck with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
Yahweh’s ark was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall we do with Yahweh’s ark? Show us with which we shall send it to its place.
They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, don’t send it empty; but by all means return him a trespass offering: then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
Behold; if it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then he has done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us; it was a chance that happened to us.
and they put Yahweh’s ark on the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.
They of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
When the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
The men of Beth Shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? To whom shall he go up from us?”
They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back Yahweh’s ark.
Come down, and bring it up to yourselves.
The men of Kiriath Jearim came, and took Yahweh’s ark, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep Yahweh’s ark.
From the day that the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh.
Then the children of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served Yahweh only.
They gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Yahweh, and fasted on that day, and said there, “We have sinned against Yahweh.
When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
The children of Israel said to Samuel, “Don’t cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Philistines.
There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
He went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.
His return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel: and he built there an altar to Yahweh.
Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beersheba.
Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel to Ramah;
Now therefore listen to their voice: however you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the way of the king who shall reign over them.
Samuel told all Yahweh’s words to the people who asked of him a king.
He said, “This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them to him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;
He will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
He will take your male servants, and your female servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work.
that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh.
The donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost.
Kish said to Saul his son, “Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys.
He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they didn’t find them: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they weren’t there: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they didn’t find them.
When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, and let us return, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys, and be anxious for us.
All that he says comes surely to pass.
Perhaps he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.
What do we have?”
The servant answered Saul again, and said, “Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver.
I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.
As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?”
They answered them, and said, “He is.
Behold, he is before you.
Hurry now, for he has come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place.
Afterwards those who are invited eat.
Now therefore go up; for at this time you shall find him.
They went up to the city.
As they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.
Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.
In the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.
As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, don’t set your mind on them; for they are found.
” Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant pass on before us” (and he passed on), “but stand still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God.
“Then you shall go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor; and three men shall meet you there going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.
Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you.
When all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, “What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”
One of the same place answered, “Who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” He said, “To seek the donkeys.
Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.
Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;
and he said to the children of Israel, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:’
but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, ‘No! Set a king over us.
’ Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes, and by your thousands.
So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, “Is there yet a man to come here?” Yahweh answered, “Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.
They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
Samuel said to all the people, “You see him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is no one like him among all the people?” All the people shouted, and said, “Let the king live!”
Then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh.
Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the army, whose hearts God had touched.
But certain worthless fellows said, “How shall this man save us?” They despised him, and brought him no present.
Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
The Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.
He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever doesn’t come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.
” The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.
He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
They said to the messengers who came, “Thus you shall tell the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.
Therefore the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.
Saul said, “There shall not a man be put to death this day; for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel.
All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.
Witness against me before Yahweh, and before his anointed.
They said, “You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything of any man’s hand.
He said to them, “Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.
” They said, “He is witness.
Samuel said to the people, “It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh, which he did to you and to your fathers.
“But they forgot Yahweh their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.
They cried to Yahweh, and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh, and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.
’
“When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us;’ when Yahweh your God was your king.
Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have asked for: and behold, Yahweh has set a king over you.
If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then both you and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh your God.
But if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh, but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then will the hand of Yahweh be against you, as it was against your fathers.
“Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh will do before your eyes.
Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.
Only fear Yahweh, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he has done for you.
But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king.
Saul reigned a year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it.
Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”
The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.
” He offered the burnt offering.
’ I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering.
Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly.
You have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you; for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel forever.
But now your kingdom shall not continue.
Samuel arose, and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin.
Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.
Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
The raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;
and another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears”;
yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.
So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on the other side.
” But he didn’t tell his father.
Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people who were with him were about six hundred men;
and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod.
The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.
Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised.
It may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no restraint on Yahweh to save by many or by few.
His armor bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart.
Turn and, behold, I am with you according to your heart.
Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will reveal ourselves to them.
If they say thus to us, ‘Wait until we come to you!’ then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.
Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, “Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves!”
The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something!” Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up after me; for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.
That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land.
Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Count now, and see who is missing from us.
” When they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.
Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.
” For the ark of God was with the children of Israel at that time.
Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before, and who went up with them into the camp, from all around, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
So Yahweh saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth Aven.
The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am avenged of my enemies.
” So none of the people tasted food.
All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.
When the people had come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.
Then one of the people answered, and said, “Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food this day.
’” The people were faint.
Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land.
Please look how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the plunder of their enemies which they found? For now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.
’” All the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed them there.
Saul built an altar to Yahweh.
” Then the priest said, “Let us draw near here to God.
Saul asked counsel of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But he didn’t answer him that day.
” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.
” The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.
Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, “Show the right.
Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done!” Jonathan told him, and said, “I certainly did taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die.
Saul said, “God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.
Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.
and the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz.
The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.
Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to him.
Now therefore listen to the voice of Yahweh’s words.
Thus says Yahweh of Armies, ‘I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way, when he came up out of Egypt.
Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don’t spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.
Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt.
He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and wouldn’t utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
Then Yahweh’s word came to Samuel, saying,
“It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.
” Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night.
Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, “You are blessed by Yahweh! I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.
Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God.
We have utterly destroyed the rest.
Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me last night.
” He said to him, “Say on.
Samuel said, “Though you were little in your own sight, weren’t you made the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;
Why then didn’t you obey the voice of Yahweh, but took the plunder, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?”
Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.
Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected Yahweh’s word, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.
Then Samuel said, “Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites!” Agag came to him cheerfully.
Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.
Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
Yahweh said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go.
I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided a king for myself among his sons.
Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.
” Yahweh said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.
Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do.
You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.
Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem.
The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?”
He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.
Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.
” He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
When they had come, he looked at Eliab, and said, “Surely Yahweh’s anointed is before him.
Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen these.
” Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and get him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.
He sent, and brought him in.
Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look on.
Yahweh said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is he.
Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward.
So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.
Saul’s servants said to him, “See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.
It shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.
Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.
Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.
Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul.
David came to Saul, and stood before him.
He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.
Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, “Why have you come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.
The Philistine said, “I defy the armies of Israel this day! Give me a man, that we may fight together!”
When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.
Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.
The Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
Jesse said to David his son, “Now take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers;
Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.
David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.
As he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.
All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were terrified.
It shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.
David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?”
The people answered him in this way, saying, “So shall it be done to the man who kills him.
David said, “What have I now done? Is there not a cause?”
When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.
David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him.
Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
David said to Saul, “Your servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when a lion or a bear came, and took a lamb out of the flock,
Your servant struck both the lion and the bear.
This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.
David said, “Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.
” Saul said to David, “Go; and Yahweh shall be with you.
David strapped his sword on his clothing, and he tried to move; for he had not tested it.
David said to Saul, “I can’t go with these; for I have not tested them.
The Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.
The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the field.
Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
Today, Yahweh will deliver you into my hand.
I will strike you, and take your head from off you.
and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn’t save with sword and spear: for the battle is Yahweh’s, and he will give you into our hand.
When the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, David hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
The men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron.
The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.
The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.
When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, “Abner, whose son is this youth?” Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I can’t tell.
The king said, “Inquire whose son the young man is!”
As they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music.
Saul had his spear in his hand;
Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him, and was departed from Saul.
When Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.
But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.
David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?”
Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.
Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David.
Saul said, “You shall tell David, ‘The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies.
’” Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
When his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law.
Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.
Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.
Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
But Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted much in David.
Jonathan told David, saying, “Saul my father seeks to kill you.
for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and Yahweh worked a great victory for all Israel.
You saw it, and rejoiced.
Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?”
Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things.
Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as before.
There was war again.
David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.
Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he stuck the spear into the wall.
David fled, and escaped that night.
Saul sent messengers to David’s house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning.
So Michal let David down through the window.
He went, fled, and escaped.
Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ hair at its head, and covered it with the clothes.
When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.
Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.
When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats’ hair at its head.
Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he is escaped?” Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’”
Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him.
When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied.
Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” One said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.
He went there to Naioth in Ramah.
He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.
He said to him, “Far from it; you shall not die.
Behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so.
Yahweh do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I don’t disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and Yahweh be with you, as he has been with my father.
You shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness of Yahweh, that I not die;
but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth.
Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.
But if I say this to the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are beyond you;’ then go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.
So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon had come, the king sat him down to eat food.
Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.
He said, ‘Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city.
My brother has commanded me to be there.
Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go away and see my brothers.
Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?
Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”
Saul cast his spear at him to strike him.
By this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.
So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
In the morning, Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.
He said to his boy, “Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.
” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
Jonathan cried after the boy, “Go fast! Hurry! Don’t delay!” Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest.
Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no man with you?”
The priest answered David, and said, “There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.
How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?”
So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.
David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.
If you will take that, take it; for there is no other except that here.
David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
He changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.
When his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down there to him.
He brought them before the king of Moab; and they lived with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.
The prophet Gad said to David, “Don’t stay in the stronghold.
Depart, and go into the land of Judah.
” Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.
Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him.
that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one who discloses to me when my son makes a treaty with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?”
Then Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
He inquired of Yahweh for him, gave him food, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
Saul said, “Hear now, you son of Ahitub.
” He answered, “Here I am, my lord.
Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?”
Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, “Who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, and is taken into your council, and is honorable in your house?
Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? Be it far from me! Don’t let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing of all this, less or more.
The king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father’s house.
” But the servants of the king wouldn’t put out their hand to fall on the priests of Yahweh.
The king said to Doeg, “Turn and attack the priests!” Doeg the Edomite turned, and he attacked the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five people who wore a linen ephod.
One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh’s priests.
David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul.
I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father’s house.
Stay with me, don’t be afraid; for he who seeks my life seeks your life.
For with me you shall be in safeguard.
Therefore David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go and strike these Philistines?” Yahweh said to David, “Go strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.
David’s men said to him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”
David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter.
When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand.
” Yahweh said, “He will come down.
It was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he gave up going there.
David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph.
David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life.
They both made a covenant before Yahweh: and David stayed in the woods, and Jonathan went to his house.
Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Doesn’t David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?
Saul said, “You are blessed by Yahweh; for you have had compassion on me.
They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.
Saul and his men went to seek him.
When David was told, he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon.
When Saul heard that, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.
Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them.
So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth.
Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.
Afterward, David’s heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.
He said to his men, “Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh’s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, since he is Yahweh’s anointed.
So David checked his men with these words, and didn’t allow them to rise against Saul.
Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to men’s words, saying, ‘Behold, David seeks your hurt?’
Some urged me to kill you; but I spared you; and I said, I will not stretch out my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh’s anointed.
May Yahweh judge between me and you, and may Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand shall not be on you.
As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness;’ but my hand shall not be on you.
Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?
It came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
He said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you.
You have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn’t kill me.
For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day.
Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father’s house.
David swore to Saul.
Saul went home; but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.
David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
Now I have heard that you have shearers.
Your shepherds have now been with us, and we didn’t hurt them, neither was there anything missing from them, all the while they were in Carmel.
Ask your young men, and they will tell you.
Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day.
Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.
But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields.
Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two bottles of wine, five sheep ready dressed, five measures of parched grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.
” But she didn’t tell her husband, Nabal.
It was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.
He has returned me evil for good.
When Abigail saw David, she hurried, and alighted from her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.
Please don’t let my lord regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he.
Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your handmaid, didn’t see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.
Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.
Please forgive the trespass of your handmaid.
Though men may rise up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God.
David said to Abigail, “Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!
Blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, that have kept me this day from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.
So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said to her, “Go up in peace to your house.
Behold, I have listened to your voice, and have granted your request.
Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king.
Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken.
Therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
About ten days later, Yahweh struck Nabal, so that he died.
Yahweh has returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head.
” David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him as wife.
When the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife.
David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they both became his wives.
Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way.
But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had certainly come.
Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?” Abishai said, “I will go down with you.
So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay around him.
Then Abishai said to David, “God has delivered up your enemy into your hand this day.
David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against Yahweh’s anointed, and be guiltless?”
David said, “As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.
Yahweh forbid that I should stretch out my hand against Yahweh’s anointed; but now please take the spear that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let us go.
So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul’s head; and they went away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Yahweh was fallen on them.
Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;
David said to Abner, “Aren’t you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord, the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.
This thing isn’t good that you have done.
As Yahweh lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, Yahweh’s anointed.
Now see where the king’s spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head.
Saul knew David’s voice, and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” David said, “It is my voice, my lord, O king.
Then Saul said, “I have sinned.
Behold, as your life was respected this day in my eyes, so let my life be respected in the eyes of Yahweh, and let him deliver me out of all oppression.
Then Saul said to David, “You are blessed, my son David.
You shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail.
” So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
David said in his heart, “I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul.
David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.
It was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
David said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there.
For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?”
Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.
The number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
David and his men went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.
David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, “Lest they should tell of us, saying, ‘David this, and this has been his way all the time he has lived in the country of the Philistines.
Achish said to David, “Know assuredly that you shall go out with me in the army, you and your men.
Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city.
Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.
When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
When Saul inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh didn’t answer him, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.
” His servants said to him, “Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at Endor.
Why then do you lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?”
For what do you see?” The woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up out of the earth.
” Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and showed respect.
Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.
Samuel said, “Why then do you ask of me, since Yahweh has departed from you and has become your adversary?
Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me.
Because you didn’t obey the voice of Yahweh, and didn’t execute his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you this day.
Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me.
Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.
Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was terrified, because of the words of Samuel.
There was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was very troubled, and said to him, “Behold, your handmaid has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.
But he refused, and said, “I will not eat.
” But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice.
The woman had a fattened calf in the house.
She hurried and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.
She brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate.
Then they rose up, and went away that night.
Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel.
The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish.
Then Achish called David, and said to him, “As Yahweh lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day.
Nevertheless, the lords don’t favor you.
Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease the lords of the Philistines.
David said to Achish, “But what have I done? What have you found in your servant so long as I have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”
Achish answered David, “I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God.
Notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, ‘He shall not go up with us to the battle.
Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you; and as soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines.
The Philistines went up to Jezreel.
When David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the South, and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,
When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.
Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
David’s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God.
David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them?” He answered him, “Pursue; for you shall surely overtake them, and shall without fail recover all.
So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.
Not a man of them escaped from there, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.
David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.
There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither plunder, nor anything that they had taken to them.
David brought back all.
David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other livestock, and said, “This is David’s plunder.
David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to stay at the brook Besor; and they went out to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him.
When David came near to the people, he greeted them.
Who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage: they shall share alike.
It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay.
Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.
The Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.
Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me!” But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified.
When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died with him.
So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.
When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.
On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
They put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.
When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,
David said to him, “Where do you come from?” He said to him, “I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.
David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?”
The young man who told him said, “As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.
When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me.
I answered, ‘Here I am.
He said to me, ‘Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.
So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen.
I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.
They mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?” He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.
David said to him, “How were you not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy Yahweh’s anointed?”
” He struck him, so that he died.
David said to him, “Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have slain Yahweh’s anointed.
David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son
How the mighty have fallen!
lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.
They told David, saying, “The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.
David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, “Blessed are you by Yahweh, that you have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.
Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
But the house of Judah followed David.
The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
Abner said to Joab, “Please let the young men arise and play before us!” Joab said, “Let them arise!”
Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle.
Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he didn’t turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
Then Abner looked behind him, and said, “Is it you, Asahel?” He answered, “It is I.
Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and grab one of the young men, and take his armor.
” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
However he refused to turn aside.
Therefore Abner with the back end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place.
As many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
Then Abner called to Joab, and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Don’t you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before you ask the people to return from following their brothers?”
So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.
But the servants of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men, so that three hundred sixty men died.
They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem.
Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.
To David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”
God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn to David, I don’t do even so to him;
He could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, “Whose is the land?” and saying, “Make your alliance with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring all Israel around to you.
That is, you shall not see my face, unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.
David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.
Then Abner said to him, “Go! Return!” and he returned.
Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, “In times past, you sought for David to be king over you.
Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.
Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.
” David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great plunder with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
When Joab and all the army who was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
When Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David didn’t know it.
Let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house.
” All the people wept again over him.
All the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun goes down.
The king said to his servants, “Don’t you know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me.
May Yahweh reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.
Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was lame of his feet.
His name was Mephibosheth.
Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him, and killed him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.
They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life! Yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel.
In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and strike the lame and the blind, who are hated by David’s soul.
” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame can’t come into the house.
David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David.
David built around from Millo and inward.
These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?” Yahweh said to David, “Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand.
David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, “Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters.
” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
They left their images there; and David and his men took them away.
The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall stir yourself up; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.
David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.
David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached for the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the cattle stumbled.
Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken out against Uzzah; and he called that place Perez Uzzah, to this day.
David was afraid of Yahweh that day; and he said, “How shall Yahweh’s ark come to me?”
Yahweh’s ark remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months: and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom, and all his house.
It was told king David, saying, “Yahweh has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God.
” David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of David with joy.
David danced before Yahweh with all his might; and David was clothed in a linen ephod.
So David and all the house of Israel brought up Yahweh’s ark with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
It was so, as Yahweh’s ark came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh; and she despised him in her heart.
They brought in Yahweh’s ark, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.
When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies.
Then David returned to bless his household.
David said to Michal, “It was before Yahweh, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Yahweh, over Israel.
Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
When the king lived in his house, and Yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies all around,
the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.
Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your heart; for Yahweh is with you.
For I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle.
I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.
and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel.
I will cause you to rest from all your enemies.
When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
I will be his father, and he shall be my son.
but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, Lord Yahweh, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
Therefore you are great, Yahweh God.
For there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make himself a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to yourself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
For you, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, ‘I will build you a house.
Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord Yahweh, have spoken it.
Let the house of your servant be blessed forever with your blessing.
When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer,
then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi.
David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness to all his people.
Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief ministers.
David said, “Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”
There was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” He said, “Your servant is he.
The king said to him, “Where is he?” Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.
Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.
Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and showed respect.
David said, “Mephibosheth.
” He answered, “Behold, your servant!”
David said to him, “Don’t be afraid of him; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father.
You shall eat bread at my table continually.
He bowed down, and said, “What is your servant, that you should look on such a dead dog as I am?”
Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master’s son.
You shall till the land for him, you, and your sons, and your servants; and you shall bring in the harvest, that your master’s son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth your master’s son shall eat bread always at my table.
” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your shall servant do.
” So Mephibosheth ate at the king’s table, like one of the king’s sons.
Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica.
All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.
After this, the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.
David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me.
” So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father.
David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
When the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.
When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.
Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.
He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.
Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and Yahweh do that which seems good to him.
So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city.
Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.
Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head.
The Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians seven hundred charioteers, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that he died there.
So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
But David stayed at Jerusalem.
At evening, David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king’s house.
David sent and inquired after the woman.
David sent to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.
When Uriah had come to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.
” Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.
But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn’t go down to his house.
David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.
When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk.
At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn’t go down to his house.
In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab.
and he commanded the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,
it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he asks you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn’t you know that they would shoot from the wall?
who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn’t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.
The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another.
Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.
When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.
Yahweh sent Nathan to David.
He came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
The rich man had very many flocks and herds,
but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised.
It grew up together with him, and with his children.
It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter.
David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this is worthy to die!
This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.
I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things.
Why have you despised Yahweh’s word, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.
“This is what Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
You will not die.
David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.
The elders of his house arose beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
On the seventh day, the child died.
The servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he didn’t listen to our voice.
He said, “While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?’
But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her.
She bore a son, and he called his name Solomon.
Yahweh loved him;
and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he named him Jedidiah, for Yahweh’s sake.
Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
After this, Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
Amnon was so troubled that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.
But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.
He said to him, “Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won’t you tell me?” Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.
Jonadab said to him, “Lay down on your bed, and pretend to be sick.
Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.
So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down.
Amnon said, “Have all men leave me.
” Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother.
Amnon said to her, “Arise, be gone!”
She said to him, “Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!” But he would not listen to her.
She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such robes were the king’s daughters who were virgins dressed.
Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.
Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister.
” So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.
But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
After two full years, Absalom had sheep shearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.
Absalom came to the king, and said, “See now, your servant has sheep shearers.
Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.
” He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him.
But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered, “Don’t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
Now therefore don’t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.
But Absalom fled.
The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him.
Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king’s sons are coming! It is as your servant said.
As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept.
The king also and all his servants wept bitterly.
But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur.
So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, showed respect, and said, “Help, O king!”
The king said to her, “What ails you?” She answered, “Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead.
’ Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth.
The king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you.
The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.
Then the woman said, “Please let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king.
For we must die, and are like water split on the ground, which can’t be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from him.
For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
Then your handmaid said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad.
Then the king answered the woman, “Please don’t hide anything from me that I ask you.
” The woman said, “Let my lord the king now speak.
to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing.
The king said, “Let him return to his own house, but let him not see my face.
When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king’s weight.
To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a beautiful face.
Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he didn’t see the king’s face.
Go and set it on fire.
” Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still.
Now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.
After this, Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate.
It was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, “What city are you from?” He said, “Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
Absalom said moreover, “Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!”
It was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance, he stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.
So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, ‘If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.
The king said to him, “Go in peace.
” So he arose, and went to Hebron.
But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’”
Two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they didn’t know anything.
Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices.
David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom.
All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why do you also go with us? Return, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile.
Return to your own place.
All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
The king said also to Zadok the priest, “Aren’t you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me.
Someone told David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.
David said to him, “If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me;
So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
Then the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours.
Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.
When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Saul came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera.
He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
Shimei said when he cursed, “Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and base fellow!
Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn’t you go with your friend?”
Hushai said to Absalom, “No; but whomever Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will stay.
So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight.
and I will bring back all the people to you.
All the people shall be in peace.
The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.
When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel has spoken like this.
Hushai said moreover, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field.
Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place.
It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!’
Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.
But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.
Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way.
Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, ‘Don’t lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.
But a boy saw them, and told Absalom.
The woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and spread out bruised grain on it; and nothing was known.
” When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
Then David came to Mahanaim.
Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.
Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
When David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
brought beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans, lentils, roasted grain,
honey, butter, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat: for they said, “The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.
David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
David sent the people out, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.
The king said to the people, “I will also surely go out with you myself.
But you are worth ten thousand of us.
The king said to them, “I will do what seems best to you.
” All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom.
So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
The people of Israel were struck there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.
For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.
Joab said to the man who told him, “Behold, you saw it, and why didn’t you strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash.
The man said to Joab, “Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn’t stretch out my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware that no one touch the young man Absalom.
Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.
They took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones.
But today you shall bear no news, because the king’s son is dead.
Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen!” The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, “But come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite.
” He said to him, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.
The watchman cried, and told the king.
The watchman said, “I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.
” The king said, “He is a good man, and comes with good news.
Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, “All is well.
” He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, “Blessed is Yahweh your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king!”
The king said, “Turn aside, and stand here.
The Cushite said, “News for my lord the king; for Yahweh has avenged you this day of all those who rose up against you.
The king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” The Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you harm, be as that young man is.
The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people; for the people heard it said that day, “The king grieves for his son.
For today I perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it would have pleased you well.
They told to all the people, saying, “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.
Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.
Now therefore why don’t you speak a word of bringing the king back?”
King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? Since the speech of all Israel has come to the king, to return him to his house.
You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh.
Why then are you the last to bring back the king?’
He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, “Return, you and all your servants.
Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.
Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he had come over the Jordan.
For your servant knows that I have sinned.
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, “Shall Shimei not be put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh’s anointed?”
Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither groomed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.
When he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”
He answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me.
What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?”
The king said to him, “Why do you speak any more of your matters? I say, you and Ziba divide the land.
Mephibosheth said to the king, “Yes, let him take all, because my lord the king has come in peace to his own house.
Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.
The king said to Barzillai, “Come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.
Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king.
Why should the king repay me with such a reward?
Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother.
The king answered, “Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you.
Then the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.
So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him.
All the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.
All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative to us.
When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them.
Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
So he struck him with it in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn’t strike him again; and he died.
Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.
He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
Then a wise woman cried out of the city, “Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, ‘Come near here, that I may speak with you.
He came near to her; and the woman said, “Are you Joab?” He answered, “I am.
” Then she said to him, “Hear the words of your handmaid.
Then she spoke, saying, “They were used to say in old times, ‘They shall surely ask counsel at Abel;’ and so they settled it.
I am among those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel.
” The woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.
Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom.
They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab.
Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;
and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;
There was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Yahweh.
Yahweh said, “It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.
The Gibeonites said to him, “It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.
” He said, “Whatever you say, that will I do for you.
They said to the king, “The man who consumed us, and who devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,
let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh.
” The king said, “I will give them.
But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Yahweh’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
They were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured on them from the sky.
It was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.
They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded.
After that God was entreated for the land.
Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you don’t quench the lamp of Israel.
There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
and he said, “Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;
Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind.
gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
As for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.
But your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down.
and sets me on my high places.
so that my arms bend a bow of brass.
You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.
Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth.
A people whom I have not known will serve me.
A people whom I have not known will serve me.
Yahweh lives! Blessed be my rock! Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,
Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.
You deliver me from the violent man.
although he doesn’t make it grow.
But all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away, because they can’t be taken with the hand,
But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear.
But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory.
David longed, and said, “Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”
The three mighty men did these things.
Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three.
He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.
Wasn’t he most honorable of the three? therefore he was made their captain: however he didn’t attain to the three.
He killed an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.
He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three.
Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.
Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
Again Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, “Go, number Israel and Judah.
Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; and they came to Dan Jaan, and around to Sidon,
So when they had gone back and forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
David’s heart struck him after that he had numbered the people.
David said to Yahweh, “I have sinned greatly in that which I have done.
But now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
When David rose up in the morning, Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,
So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in your land? Now answer, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.
David said to Gad, “I am in distress.
Let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are great.
David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.
Araunah looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him.
all this, king, does Araunah give to the king.
” Araunah said to the king, “May Yahweh your God accept you.
” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
So Yahweh was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suf, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
“Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, ‘You have lived long enough at this mountain.
Turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all the places near there, in the Arabah, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
Behold, I have set the land before you.
Go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.
I spoke to you at that time, saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone.
Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!
How can I myself alone bear your problems, your burdens, and your strife?
Take wise men of understanding and well known according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.
You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to do.
So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.
I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.
Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you.
Go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you.
Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed.
The thing pleased me well.
I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe.
They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.
Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God.
You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
Then I said to you, “Don’t dread, neither be afraid of them.
Yahweh your God who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.
Yet in this thing you didn’t believe Yahweh your God,
Yahweh heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,
“Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,
Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there.
Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there.
Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be captured or killed, and your children, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and I will give it to, and they shall possess it.
But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
Yahweh said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.
So I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.
So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.
“You have encircled this mountain long enough.
Command the people, saying, ‘You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you.
Therefore be careful.
You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat.
For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand.
Yahweh said to me, “Don’t bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you any of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.
(The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim.
These also are considered to be Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.
They destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.
“Now rise up, and cross over the brook Zered.
” We went over the brook Zered.
The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea, until we had come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.
Moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
“You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab.
(That also is considered a land of Rephaim: Rephaim lived there before; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
a great people, many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place;
and the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and lived in their place.
“Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.
You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink.
Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.
Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people.
Yahweh our God delivered up all before us.
Only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn’t come near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.
Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan.
Yahweh said to me, “Don’t fear him; for I have delivered him, with all his people, and his land, into your hand.
We took all his cities at that time.
There was not a city which we didn’t take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides a great many towns without walls.
We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.
We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon.
(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.
We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim.
This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and its cities, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites:
and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan.
(The same is called the land of Rephaim.
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.
I gave Gilead to Machir.
To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you,
until Yahweh gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your God gives them beyond the Jordan.
You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God himself fights for you.
I begged Yahweh at that time, saying,
For what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do works like yours, and mighty acts like yours?
But Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and didn’t listen to me.
Speak no more to me of this matter.
But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.
So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, gives you.
You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you.
Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor; for all the men who followed Baal Peor, Yahweh your God has destroyed them from among you.
But you who were faithful to Yahweh your God are all alive this day.
Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh my God commanded me, that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it.
Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all these statutes, and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
For what great nation is there, that has a god so near to them, as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on him?
What great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
Only be careful, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children’s children;
You came near and stood under the mountain.
Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice.
Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.
Be very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire,
But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day.
I must not go over the Jordan; but you shall go over, and possess that good land.
Be careful, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he made with you, and make yourselves an engraved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you.
For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.
When you shall father children, and children’s children, and you shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make an engraved image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, to provoke him to anger;
You will not prolong your days on it, but will utterly be destroyed.
Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh will lead you away.
There you shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall find him, when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.
When you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God, and listen to his voice.
Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?
Or has God tried to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.
There is no one else.
You shall keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh your God gives you, forever.
Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;
that the man slayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares, and didn’t hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:
Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.
beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck, when they came out of Egypt.
They took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;
from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Sion (the same is Hermon),
and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, “Hear, Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and observe to do them.
Yahweh our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
Yahweh didn’t make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
Yahweh spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of the midst of the fire,
(I stood between Yahweh and you at that time, to show you Yahweh’s word: for you were afraid because of the fire, and didn’t go up onto the mountain;) saying,
“I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
“You shall have no other gods before me.
and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
“You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain: for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God, in which you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
“You shall not murder.
“You shall not commit adultery.
“You shall not steal.
“You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.
Neither shall you desire your neighbor’s house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s.
Yahweh spoke these words to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice.
He added no more.
He wrote them on two stone tablets, and gave them to me.
When you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
and you said, “Behold, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire.
We have seen this day that God does speak with man, and he lives.
Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us.
If we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more, then we shall die.
For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
They have well said all that they have spoken.
“Go tell them, ‘Return to your tents.
You shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.
Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it;
Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
You shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.
These words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart;
You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates.
It shall be, when Yahweh your God brings you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you didn’t build,
and houses full of all good things, which you didn’t fill, and cisterns dug out, which you didn’t dig, vineyards and olive trees, which you didn’t plant, and you shall eat and be full;
then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
You shall fear Yahweh your God; and you shall serve him, and shall swear by his name.
You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are around you;
for Yahweh your God in your midst is a jealous God; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.
You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted him in Massah.
You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.
You shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh; that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,
to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
When your son asks you in time to come, saying, “What do the testimonies, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh our God has commanded you mean?”
and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;
and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.
Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.
It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this commandment before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.
neither shall you make marriages with them.
For he will turn away your son from following me, that they may serve other gods.
So Yahweh’s anger would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly.
For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God.
Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
Yahweh didn’t set his love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples:
and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them.
You shall therefore keep the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command you this day, to do them.
You shall be blessed above all peoples.
There shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your livestock.
Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, will he put on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you.
You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you.
Your eye shall not pity them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that would be a snare to you.
If you shall say in your heart, “These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?”
you shall not be afraid of them.
the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your God brought you out.
So shall Yahweh your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you.
Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you little by little.
You may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.
But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they are destroyed.
He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under the sky.
No one will be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them.
You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your God.
You shall observe to do all the commandments which I command you this day, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers.
You shall remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or not.
He humbled you, and allowed you to be hungry, and fed you with manna, which you didn’t know, neither did your fathers know; that he might teach you that man does not live by bread only, but man lives by every word that proceeds out of Yahweh’s mouth.
Your clothing didn’t grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years.
You shall consider in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so Yahweh your God disciplines you.
You shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
For Yahweh your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing into valleys and hills;
a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey;
then your heart might be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;
who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who poured water for you out of the rock of flint;
who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn’t know; that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end:
and lest you say in your heart, “My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.
But you shall remember Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as at this day.
It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish.
As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you wouldn’t listen to Yahweh your God’s voice.
Know therefore this day, that Yahweh your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire.
He will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you.
So you shall drive them out, and make them perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you.
Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn’t give you this good land to possess for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.
Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you.
Yahweh delivered to me the two stone tablets written with the finger of God On them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant.
They have made a molten image for themselves!”
Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.
So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire.
The two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
You had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.
I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights.
I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.
For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you.
But Yahweh listened to me that time also.
I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust.
I threw its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain.
At Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked Yahweh to wrath.
So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you.
I prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, don’t destroy your people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
lest the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.
At that time Yahweh said to me, “Cut two stone tablets like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood.
(The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah.
There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his place.
At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.
Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your God spoke to him.
Yahweh said to me, “Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.
Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
Behold, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.
For Yahweh your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn’t respect persons, nor takes reward.
He does execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and clothing.
He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen.
Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep his instructions, his statutes, his ordinances, and his commandments, always.
Know this day: for I don’t speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm,
his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;
and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;
and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place;
and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel;
but your eyes have seen all of Yahweh’s great work which he did.
Therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where you go over to possess it;
and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.
but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water from the rain of the sky,
a land which Yahweh your God cares for.
Yahweh your God’s eyes are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.
It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil.
I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full.
Be careful, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him;
then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
No man will be able to stand before you.
Yahweh your God will lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you tread on, as he has spoken to you.
Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:
the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I command you this day;
and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which you have not known.
It shall happen, when Yahweh your God brings you into the land where you go to possess it, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.
For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and you shall possess it, and dwell therein.
You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.
These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that you live on the earth.
You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
But to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, you shall seek his habitation, and there you shall come.
There you shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, your vows, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock.
for you haven’t yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Yahweh your God gives you.
But when you go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you, so that you dwell in safety;
then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh.
You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your sons, your daughters, your male servants, your female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
Be careful that you don’t offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see;
but in the place which Yahweh chooses in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.
Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat flesh within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to Yahweh your God’s blessing which he has given you.
You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand;
but you shall eat them before Yahweh your God in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates.
You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God in all that you put your hand to.
Be careful that you don’t forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
When Yahweh your God enlarges your border, as he has promised you, and you shall say, “I want to eat meat,” because your soul desires to eat meat; you may eat meat, after all the desire of your soul.
If the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to put his name there, is too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates, after all the desire of your soul.
Even as the gazelle and as the deer is eaten, so you shall eat of it.
The unclean and the clean may eat of it alike.
Only be sure that you don’t eat the blood; for the blood is the life.
You shall not eat the life with the flesh.
You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.
Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which Yahweh shall choose.
You shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of Yahweh your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God; and you shall eat the flesh.
Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in Yahweh your God’s eyes.
When Yahweh your God cuts off the nations from before you, where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them, and dwell in their land;
be careful that you are not ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before you; and that you not inquire after their gods, saying, “How do these nations serve their gods? I will do likewise.
You shall not do so to Yahweh your God; for every abomination to Yahweh, which he hates, have they done to their gods; for they even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods.
and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, “Let us go after other gods” (which you have not known) “and let us serve them”;
you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams; for Yahweh your God is testing you, to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk in.
So you shall remove the evil from your midst.
If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, who is as your own soul, entices you secretly, saying, “Let us go and serve other gods,” which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;
you shall not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him;
You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more wickedness like this in your midst.
If you shall hear about one of your cities, which Yahweh your God gives you to dwell there, that
Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination was done in your midst,
Nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand, that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show you mercy, and have compassion on you, and multiply you, as he has sworn to your fathers;
when you listen to Yahweh your God’s voice, to keep all his commandments which I command you this day, to do that which is right in Yahweh your God’s eyes.
You are the children of Yahweh your God.
You shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
You shall not eat any abominable thing.
These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,
the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the chamois.
Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two and chews the cud, among the animals, that may you eat.
Because they chew the cud but don’t part the hoof, they are unclean to you.
You shall not eat their flesh, and you shall not touch their carcasses.
These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales may you eat.
Of all clean birds you may eat.
But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the osprey,
the red kite, the falcon, the kite after its kind,
every raven after its kind,
the ostrich, the owl, the seagull, the hawk after its kind,
the little owl, the great owl, the horned owl,
the pelican, the vulture, the cormorant,
the stork, the heron after its kind, the hoopoe, and the bat.
You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself.
You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.
You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed, that which comes out of the field year by year.
If the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it, because the place is too far from you, which Yahweh your God shall choose, to set his name there, when Yahweh your God shall bless you;
then you shall turn it into money, and bind up the money in your hand, and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose.
At the end of every three years you shall bring all the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall store it within your gates.
At the end of every seven years, you shall cancel debts.
He shall not require payment from his neighbor and his brother; because Yahweh’s release has been proclaimed.
However there shall be no poor with you (for Yahweh will surely bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it)
if only you diligently listen to Yahweh your God’s voice, to observe to do all this commandment which I command you this day.
For Yahweh your God will bless you, as he promised you.
You will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow.
You will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.
If a poor man, one of your brothers, is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother;
but you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need, which he lacks.
Beware that there not be a base thought in your heart, saying, “The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand”; and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing; and he cry to Yahweh against you, and it be sin to you.
You shall surely give, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him; because that for this thing Yahweh your God will bless you in all your work, and in all that you put your hand to.
Therefore I command you to surely open your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor, in your land.
If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you, and serves you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.
When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty.
You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your wine press.
As Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.
You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you.
Therefore I command you this thing today.
Also to your female servant you shall do likewise.
It shall not seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you; for he has been double value of a hired hand as he served you six years.
Yahweh your God will bless you in all that you do.
You shall dedicate all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock to Yahweh your God.
You shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock.
You shall eat it before Yahweh your God year by year in the place which Yahweh shall choose, you and your household.
If it has any defect, is lame or blind, or has any defect whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God.
You shall eat it within your gates.
Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God; for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you out of Egypt by night.
You shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Yahweh shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.
You shall eat no leavened bread with it.
You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates, which Yahweh your God gives you;
You shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God chooses.
In the morning you shall return to your tents.
Six days you shall eat unleavened bread.
On the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God.
You shall count for yourselves seven weeks.
From the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks.
You shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give, according as Yahweh your God blesses you.
You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God: you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, the Levite who is within your gates, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are in your midst, in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.
You shall keep the feast of tents seven days, after you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your wine press.
You shall rejoice in your feast, you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates.
Three times in a year all of your shall males appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he chooses: in the feast of unleavened bread, in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tents.
They shall not appear before Yahweh empty.
Every man shall give as he is able, according to Yahweh your God’s blessing which he has given you.
You shall make judges and officers in all your gates, which Yahweh your God gives you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
You shall follow that which is altogether just, that you may live, and inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
You shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Yahweh your God, which you shall make for yourselves.
Neither shall you set yourself up a sacred stone which Yahweh your God hates.
You shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox, or a sheep, in which is a defect, or anything evil; for that is an abomination to Yahweh your God.
If there is found in your midst, within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you, a man or woman who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, in transgressing his covenant,
and has gone and served other gods, and worshiped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the stars of the sky, which I have not commanded;
At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death.
You shall come to the priests who are Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days.
You shall do according to the decisions of the verdict which they shall give you from that place which Yahweh chooses.
according to the decisions of the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do.
You shall not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.
The man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die.
You shall put away the evil from Israel.
All the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
When you have come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and possess it, and dwell in it, and say, “I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me”;
He shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write himself a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before the priests the Levites.
It shall be with him, and he shall read from it all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them;
The priests the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel.
They shall have no inheritance among their brothers.
Yahweh is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them.
This shall be the priests’ due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the inner parts.
The first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him.
For Yahweh your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in Yahweh’s name, him and his sons for ever.
If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel, where he lives as a foreigner, and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose;
then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his God, as all his brothers the Levites do, who stand there before Yahweh.
There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,
For whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh.
Because of these abominations, Yahweh your God drives them out from before you.
For these nations that you shall dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery and to diviners; but as for you, Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do.
Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from your midst, of your brothers, like me.
You shall listen to him.
This is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, “Let me not hear again the voice of Yahweh my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die.
Yahweh said to me, “They have well said that which they have spoken.
I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers, like you.
I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.
It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.
But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.
You may say in your heart, “How shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken?”
When a prophet speaks in Yahweh’s name, if the thing doesn’t follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Yahweh has not spoken.
The prophet has spoken it presumptuously.
You shall not be afraid of him.
When Yahweh your God cuts off the nations, whose land Yahweh your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;
you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the midst of your land, which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.
You shall prepare the way, and divide the borders of your land, which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, into three parts, that every man slayer may flee there.
This is the case of the man slayer who shall flee there and live.
Whoever kills his neighbor unawares, and didn’t hate him in time past;
Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the man slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally; even though he was not worthy of death, because he didn’t hate him in time past.
Therefore I command you to set apart three cities for yourselves.
If Yahweh your God enlarges your border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers;
if you keep all this commandment to do it, which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to walk ever in his ways; then you shall add three cities more for yourselves, besides these three.
This is so that innocent blood will not be shed in the midst of your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, leaving blood guilt on you.
Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.
If an unrighteous witness rises up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing,
and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother;
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother.
Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and will never again commit any such evil in your midst.
Your eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots, and a people more than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,
and shall tell them, “Hear, Israel, you draw near this day to battle against your enemies.
Don’t let your heart faint! Don’t be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them;
The officers shall speak to the people, saying, “What man is there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit.
What man is there who has pledged to be married a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, “What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest his brother’s heart melt as his heart.
It shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people.
When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.
It shall be, if it makes you answer of peace, and opens to you, then it shall be, that all the people who are found therein shall become forced laborers to you, and shall serve you.
If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it.
When Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword;
but the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all its plunder, you shall take for plunder for yourself.
But of the cities of these peoples, that Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes;
but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Yahweh your God has commanded you;
When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them; for you may eat of them.
If someone is found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess, lying in the field, and it isn’t known who has struck him;
” The blood shall be forgiven them.
So you shall put away the innocent blood from your midst, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.
When you go out to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your God delivers them into your hands, and you carry them away captive,
and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have a desire to her, and desire to take her as your wife;
then you shall bring her home to your house.
She shall shave her head and trim her nails.
It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she desires; but you shall not sell her at all for money.
The right of the firstborn is his.
If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not listen to them;
then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place.
If a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree;
his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of God; that you don’t defile your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.
So you shall do with his donkey.
So you shall do with his garment.
You may not hide yourself.
You shall not see your brother’s donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them.
A woman shall not wear men’s clothing, neither shall a man put on women’s clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God.
If you come across a bird’s nest on the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young.
You shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take for yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days.
When you build a new house, then you shall make a railing around your roof, so that you don’t bring blood on your house if anyone falls from there.
You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
You shall not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.
If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, hates her,
then the young lady’s father and mother shall take and bring the tokens of the young lady’s virginity to the elders of the city in the gate.
” They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
She shall be his wife.
But if this thing is true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady;
then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones; the lady, because she didn’t cry, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor’s wife.
There is in the lady no sin worthy of death; for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and kills him, even so is this matter;
for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was no one to save her.
then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady’s father fifty shekels of silver.
She shall be his wife, because he has humbled her.
A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt.
He who is emasculated by crushing or cutting shall not enter into Yahweh’s assembly.
A person born of a forbidden union shall not enter into Yahweh’s assembly; even to the tenth generation shall no one of his enter into Yahweh’s assembly.
An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into Yahweh’s assembly; even to the tenth generation shall no one belonging to them enter into Yahweh’s assembly forever;
because they didn’t meet you with bread and with water on the way, when you came out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.
Nevertheless Yahweh your God wouldn’t listen to Balaam; but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing to you, because Yahweh your God loved you.
You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever.
You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother.
You shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner in his land.
The children of the third generation who are born to them may enter into Yahweh’s assembly.
When you go out and camp against your enemies, then you shall keep yourselves from every evil thing.
but it shall be, when evening comes, he shall bathe himself in water.
You shall have a place also outside of the camp where you go relieve yourself.
It shall be, when you relieve yourself, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover your excrement;
for Yahweh your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you.
He shall dwell with you, in your midst, in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases him best.
You shall not oppress him.
You may lend on interest to a foreigner; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest, that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you go in to possess it.
When you vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack to pay it; for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.
But if you refrain from making a vow, it shall be no sin in you.
You shall observe and do that which has gone out of your lips.
Whatever you have vowed to Yahweh your God as a freewill offering, which you have promised with your mouth, you must do.
When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your container.

He shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken.
No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone as a pledge; for he takes a life in pledge.
Remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam, by the way as you came out of Egypt.
When you lend your neighbor any kind of loan, you shall not go into his house to get his pledge.
You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you lend shall bring the pledge outside to you.
If he is a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge.
You shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you.
You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is one of your brothers, or one of the foreigners who are in your land within your gates.
The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers.
Every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
You shall not deprive the foreigner or the fatherless of justice, nor take a widow’s clothing in pledge;
but you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you there.
Therefore I command you to do this thing.
When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it.
It shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.

It shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt.

You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the grain.
If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies, and has no son, the wife of the dead shall not be married outside to a stranger.
Her husband’s brother shall go in to her, and take her as his wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her.

His name shall be called in Israel, “The house of him who had his shoe removed.

You shall not have in your bag diverse weights, one heavy and one light.
You shall have a perfect and just measure, that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
Remember what Amalek did to you by the way as you came out of Egypt;
Therefore it shall be, when Yahweh your God has given you rest from all your enemies all around, in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it, that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky.
It shall be, when you have come in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, possess it, and dwell in it,

You shall put it in a basket, and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.

He went down into Egypt, and lived there, few in number.
Then we cried to Yahweh, the God of our fathers.
Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, with great terror, with signs, and with wonders;
and he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
” You shall set it down before Yahweh your God, and worship before Yahweh your God.
You shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite, and the foreigner who is in your midst.
You shall say before Yahweh your God, “I have put away the holy things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your commandment which you have commanded me.
I have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have I forgotten them.
Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the ground which you have given us, as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
This day Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances.
You shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart and with all your soul.
Yahweh has declared this day that you are a people for his own possession, as he has promised you, and that you should keep all his commandments.
It shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, that you shall set yourself up great stones, and coat them with plaster.

It shall be, when you have passed over the Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, on Mount Ebal, and you shall coat them with plaster.
You shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones.
You shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly.

You shall be blessed in the city, and you shall be blessed in the field.
You shall be blessed in the fruit of your body, the fruit of your ground, the fruit of your animals, the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock.

They will come out against you one way, and will flee before you seven ways.

You will lend to many nations, and you will not borrow.

and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen to Yahweh your God’s voice, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day, that all these curses will come on you, and overtake you.
You will be cursed in the city, and you will be cursed in the field.

The fruit of your body, the fruit of your ground, the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock will be cursed.
You will be cursed when you come in, and you will be cursed when you go out.

Yahweh will strike you with consumption, with fever, with inflammation, with fiery heat, with the sword, with blight, and with mildew.
They will pursue you until you perish.
Your sky that is over your head will be brass, and the earth that is under you will be iron.
You will be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth.
Your dead body will be food to all birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth; and there will be no one to frighten them away.
Yahweh will strike you with the boils of Egypt, with the tumors, with the scurvy, and with the itch, of which you can not be healed.
Yahweh will strike you with madness, with blindness, and with astonishment of heart.
You will grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways.
You will plant a vineyard, and not use its fruit.
Your ox will be slain before your eyes, and you will not eat any of it.
Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and you will have no one to save you.
A nation which you don’t know eat the fruit of your ground and all of your work.
You will only be oppressed and crushed always;
so that the sights that you see with your eyes will drive you mad.
Yahweh will strike you in the knees and in the legs with a sore boil, of which you can not be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.
There you will serve other gods of wood and stone.

You will plant vineyards and dress them, but you will neither drink of the wine, nor harvest, because worms will eat them.
You will father sons and daughters, but they will not be yours; for they will go into captivity.
Locusts will consume all of your trees and the fruit of your ground.
The foreigner who is in your midst will mount up above you higher and higher, and you will come down lower and lower.
He will be the head, and you will be the tail.
They will be for a sign and for a wonder to you and to your seed forever.
Because you didn’t serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things;
therefore you will serve your enemies whom Yahweh sends against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in lack of all things.
He will put an iron yoke on your neck, until he has destroyed you.
Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies; a nation whose language you will not understand;
a nation of fierce facial expressions, that doesn’t respect the elderly, nor show favor to the young,
They will besiege you in all your gates, until your high and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted, throughout all your land.
They will besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land, which Yahweh your God has given you.
You will eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom Yahweh your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies will distress you.
The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye will be evil toward the husband that she loves, toward her son, toward her daughter,
If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, YAHWEH YOUR GOD;
then Yahweh will make your plagues fearful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues, and of long duration, and severe sicknesses, and of long duration.
He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they will cling to you.
You will be left few in number, even though you were as the stars of the sky for multitude; because you didn’t listen to Yahweh your God’s voice.
It will happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you.
You will be plucked from off of the land where you go in to possess it.
Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth.
There you will serve other gods, which you have not known, you nor your fathers, even wood and stone.
Your life will hang in doubt before you.
You will be afraid night and day, and will have no assurance of your life.
In the morning you will say, “I wish it were evening!” and at evening you will say, “I wish it were morning!” for the fear of your heart which you will fear, and for the sights which your eyes will see.
These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
Moses called to all Israel, and said to them: Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh did in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
But Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.
I have led you forty years in the wilderness.
You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink; that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.
We took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.
Therefore keep the words of this covenant and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.
All of you stand this day in the presence of Yahweh your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel,
your little ones, your wives, and the foreigners who are in the midst of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water;
that he may establish you this day as his people, and that he may be your God, as he spoke to you, and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
Neither do I make this covenant and this oath with you only,
but with those who stand here with us this day before Yahweh our God, and also with those who are not here with us this day
(for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed;
and you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);
Yahweh will set him apart for evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all of the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.
The generation to come, your children who will rise up after you, and the foreigner who will come from a far land, will say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick;
and that all of its land is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, doesn’t produce, nor does any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath;
even all the nations will say, “Why has Yahweh done thus to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?”
Then men will say, “Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt,
Therefore Yahweh’s anger was kindled against this land, to bring on it all the curses that are written in this book.
Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and thrust them into another land, as at this day.
and return to Yahweh your God, and obey his voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul;
Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you will possess it.
He will do you good, and increase your numbers more than your fathers.
Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.
You shall return and obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all his commandments which I command you this day.
if you will obey Yahweh your God’s voice, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.
For this commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you or too distant.
But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
I denounce to you this day, that you will surely perish.
You will not prolong your days in the land where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it.
Yahweh has said to me, ‘You shall not go over this Jordan.
Yahweh your God himself will go over before you.
Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.
Yahweh himself is who goes before you.
Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tents,
Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and the foreigners who are within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;
Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, your days approach that you must die.
Call Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him.
” Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers.
This people will rise up, and play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them.
I will be with you.
When Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, saying,
“Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.
For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck.
Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against Yahweh.
How much more after my death?
Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.
butter from the herd, and milk from the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat.
I will see what their end will be; for they are a very perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.
I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people.
I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people.
I will spend my arrows on them.
lest they should say, ‘Our hand is exalted,
There is no understanding in them.
For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah.
For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.
Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,
For you shall see the land from a distance; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel.
This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
He came from the ten thousands of holy ones.
His horns are the horns of the wild ox.
“There is no one like God, Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens for your help, in his excellency on the skies.
He thrust out the enemy from before you, and said, ‘Destroy!’
You will tread on their high places.
Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho.
Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,
Yahweh said to him, “This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your seed.
’ I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.
So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, according to Yahweh’s word.
His eye was not dim, nor his strength gone.
The children of Israel listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation.
The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.
Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn’t know Joseph.
He said to his people, “Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.
Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and escape out of the land.
Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens.
They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.
But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out.
They were grieved because of the children of Israel.
The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women aren’t like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and give birth before the midwife comes to them.
God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.
The woman conceived, and bore a son.
When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.
She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank.
Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the river.
” The woman took the child, and nursed it.
In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers, and looked at their burdens.
He said to him who did the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow?”
When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, “How is it that you have returned so early today?”
She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land.
Yahweh’s angel appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush.
He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
Moses said, “I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
Moreover he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
” Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.
Yahweh said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.
Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
He said, “Certainly I will be with you.
Moses said to God, “Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you;’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ What should I tell them?”
God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM,” and he said, “You shall tell the children of Israel this: ‘I AM has sent me to you.
I know that the king of Egypt won’t give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand.
You shall plunder the Egyptians.
Yahweh said furthermore to him, “Now put your hand inside your cloak.
He said, “Put your hand inside your cloak again.
The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.
Moses said to Yahweh, “O Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
Yahweh said to him, “Who made man’s mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Isn’t it I, Yahweh?
You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.
” Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.
You shall tell Pharaoh, ‘Thus says Yahweh, Israel is my son, my firstborn,
Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.
On the way at a lodging place, Yahweh met Moses and wanted to kill him.
Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.
So he let him alone.
Then she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.
Yahweh said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.
” He went, and met him on God’s mountain, and kissed him.
Moses told Aaron all Yahweh’s words with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had instructed him.
Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.
Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.
The people believed, and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.
Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, “This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.
Pharaoh said, “Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don’t know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go.
They said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us.
The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
“You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before.
Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor therein; and don’t let them pay any attention to lying words.
The taskmasters were urgent saying, “Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!”
Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants?
No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, ‘Make brick!’ and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.
But he said, “You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh.
and they said to them, “May Yahweh look at you, and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.
For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people; neither have you delivered your people at all.
God spoke to Moses, and said to him, “I am Yahweh;
I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens.
Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn’t listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
“Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, “Behold, the children of Israel haven’t listened to me.
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a command to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Yahweh said, “Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.
These are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt.
These are that Moses and Aaron.
On the day when Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh, when I stretch out my hand on Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
“When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Perform a miracle!’ then you shall tell Aaron, ‘Take your rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.
Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Yahweh had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn.
The fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.
The fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians couldn’t drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.
and the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.
Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
The magicians did the same thing with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
The frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people.
Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to Yahweh concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh.
They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.
But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and didn’t listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken.
They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man, and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
The magicians tried with their enchantments to produce lice, but they couldn’t.
Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God:” and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he didn’t listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.
I will put a division between my people and your people: by tomorrow shall this sign be.
Moses said, “It isn’t appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Yahweh our God.
We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, as he shall command us.
Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.
Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, ‘This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, that they may serve me.
For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still,
behold, the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence.
Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel.
Yahweh appointed a set time, saying, “Tomorrow Yahweh shall do this thing in the land.
Yahweh did that thing on the next day; and all the livestock of Egypt died, but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died.
Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead.
But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he didn’t let the people go.
The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he didn’t let the children of Israel go, just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in their midst,
Moses said, “We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh.
Yahweh turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea.
Our livestock also shall go with us.
Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!”
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.
Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.
Moses said, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt,
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of livestock.
There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor shall be any more.
You shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:
The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.
You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever.
There shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a foreigner, or one who is born in the land.
’” The people bowed their heads and worshiped.
The children of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, “Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said!
Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!”
The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We are all dead men.
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked.
The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children.
A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock.
They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt; for it wasn’t leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn’t wait, neither had they prepared for themselves any food.
Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.
No foreigner shall eat of it,
All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you.
That same day, Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
Moses said to the people, “Remember this day, in which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place.
No leavened bread shall be eaten.
This day you go out in the month Abib.
It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.
You shall tell your son in that day, saying, ‘It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came out of Egypt.
You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
“It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and shall give it you,
that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb, and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal.
The males shall be Yahweh’s.
When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of animal.
It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes: for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt.
When Pharaoh had let the people go, God didn’t lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, “Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt”;
They took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn’t depart from before the people.
Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, ‘They are entangled in the land.
He prepared his chariot, and took his army with him;
and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.
Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand.
Isn’t this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?’ For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
Yahweh will fight for you, and you shall be still.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Why do you cry to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward.
Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.
The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea: all of Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
In the morning watch, Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army.
He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, “Let’s flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!”
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it.
Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians, and the people feared Yahweh; and they believed in Yahweh, and in his servant Moses.
Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh, and said, “I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously.
Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.
Therefore its name was called Marah.
The people murmured against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?”
Then he cried to Yahweh.
Yahweh showed him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet.
There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested them;
They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
They took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
The whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;
Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, “At evening, then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt;
and in the morning, then you shall see Yahweh’s glory; because he hears your murmurings against Yahweh.
Who are we, that you murmur against us?”
And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh.
Moses said to Aaron, “Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, ‘Come near before Yahweh, for he has heard your murmurings.
As Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, Yahweh’s glory appeared in the cloud.
“I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel.
In the evening, quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.
Moses said to them, “It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat.
The children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.
When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack.
Moses said to them, “Let no one leave of it until the morning.
Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath.
On the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.
Yahweh said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?
Behold, because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days.
So the people rested on the seventh day.
Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, ‘Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.
Moses said to Aaron, “Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept throughout your generations.
As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.
Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to Yahweh’s commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink.
The people were thirsty for water there; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?”
Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go.
Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb.
You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.
” Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
When he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky.
Moses built an altar, and called its name Yahweh our Banner.
He said, “Yah has sworn: ‘Yahweh will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt.
Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him.
They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.
Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of the thing in which they dealt arrogantly against them.
Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God.
Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
On the next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening.
When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, “What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?”
Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you do is not good.
You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you.
It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves.
So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you.
If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all of these people also will go to their place in peace.
Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain.
Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain, saying, “This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:
Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine;
’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.
Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Yahweh commanded him.
All the people answered together, and said, “All that Yahweh has spoken we will do.
” Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.
” Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,
and be ready against the third day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.
No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.
’ When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain.
Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
He said to the people, “Be ready by the third day.
Don’t have sexual relations with a woman.
On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.
Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.
Mount Sinai, all it, smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.
When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain.
So Moses went down to the people, and told them.
“You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain, for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and made it holy.
“Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance.
They said to Moses, “Speak with us yourself, and we will listen; but don’t let God speak with us, lest we die.
Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid, for God has come to test you, and that his fear may be before you, that you won’t sin.
The people stayed at a distance, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
Yahweh said to Moses, “This is what you shall tell the children of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
You shall most certainly not make alongside of me gods of silver, or gods of gold for yourselves.
You shall make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your cattle.
In every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you.
Neither shall you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed to it.
If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.
But if the servant shall plainly say, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children.
I will not go out free;’
If she doesn’t please her master, who has married her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed.
He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt deceitfully with her.
If he marries her to his son, he shall deal with her as a daughter.

and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of workmanship.

When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.
Aaron said to them, “Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.
All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.
He received what they handed him, and fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said, “These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!
They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
Yahweh said to Moses, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.
Moses begged Yahweh his God, and said, “Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
Yahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.
The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables.
He said, “It isn’t the voice of those who shout for victory, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear.
He took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
Moses said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?”
Aaron said, “Don’t let the anger of my lord grow hot.
You know the people, that they are set on evil.
For they said to me, ‘Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.
When Moses saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies),
then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is on Yahweh’s side, come to me!” All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.
He said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.
The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.
Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, “Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.
Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written.
Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you.
Behold, my angel shall go before you.
Nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin.
Yahweh struck the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Depart, go up from here, you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your seed.
I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
to a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in your midst, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you on the way.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Tell the children of Israel, ‘You are a stiff-necked people.
The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.
” Everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.
When Moses went out to the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent.
When Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and spoke with Moses.
Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.
He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn’t depart from the Tent.
Moses said to Yahweh, “Behold, you tell me, ‘Bring up this people:’ and you haven’t let me know whom you will send with me.
Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people.
I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
He said, “You cannot see my face, for man may not see me and live.
It will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by;
then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Chisel two stone tablets like the first: and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.
Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed Yahweh’s name.
Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.
He said, “If now I have found favor in your sight, Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us; although this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.
He said, “Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which you are shall see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you.
Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare in your midst:
for you shall worship no other god: for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
“Don’t make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice;
“You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.
“All that opens the womb is mine; and all your livestock that is male, the firstborn of cow and sheep.
The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck.
“Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.
“You shall observe the feast of weeks with the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of harvest at the year’s end.
For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh, your God, three times in the year.
“You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning.
“You shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of Yahweh your God.
He was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread, nor drank water.
He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
But when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.
Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said to them, “These are the words which Yahweh has commanded, that you should do them.
You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the Sabbath day.
‘Take from among you an offering to Yahweh.

He has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
“Bezalel and Oholiab shall work with every wise-hearted man, in whom Yahweh has put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that Yahweh has commanded.

“On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.
You shall put the ark of the testimony in it, and you shall screen the ark with the veil.
You shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are on it.
You shall bring in the lamp stand, and light its lamps.
You shall set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
“You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.
You shall set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and shall put water therein.
You shall set up the court around it, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.
“You shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shall make it holy, and all its furniture: and it will be holy.
You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar will be most holy.
“You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall wash them with water.
You shall put on Aaron the holy garments; and you shall anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister to me in the priest’s office.
Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
He took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark.
He brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
He put the lamp stand in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
He lit the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

When they went into the Tent of Meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
He raised up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court.
Moses wasn’t able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh’s glory filled the tabernacle.
but if the cloud wasn’t taken up, then they didn’t travel until the day that it was taken up.
For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
The earth was formless and empty.
Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
God saw the light, and saw that it was good.
God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”.
God called the dry land “earth”, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”.
God saw that it was good.
God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth”; and it was so.
There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years;
and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth”; and it was so.
God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.
He also made the stars.
God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,
God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky.
God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind.
God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.
There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind”; and it was so.
God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind.
God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;” and it was so.
God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.
There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.
The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished.
On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.
God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work of creation which he had done.
This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens.
No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth.
but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.
Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers.
The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
The fourth river is the Euphrates.
Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it.
Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;
but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.
Yahweh God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone.
I will make him a helper comparable to him.
Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.
Whatever the man called every living creature became its name.
Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh.
Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made.
He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?’”
The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden,
but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden.
God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.
The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t surely die,
for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves.
They heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.
Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”
The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.
Yahweh God said to the woman, “What have you done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.
Yahweh God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, you are cursed above all livestock, and above every animal of the field.
It will yield thorns and thistles to you; and you will eat the herb of the field.
Yahweh God made coats of animal skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.
Yahweh God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil.
Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,
Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.
Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?
If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door.
Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.
Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?” He said, “I don’t know.
Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.
I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.
Whoever finds me will kill me.
Yahweh said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.
” Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him.
His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.
Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron.
Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah.
She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.
A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh.
Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.
The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he became the father of other sons and daughters.
All the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years, then he died.
Seth lived one hundred five years, then became the father of Enosh.

and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years, then he died.
Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Jared.
Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
All the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years, then he died.

Jared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
All the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, then he died.
Enoch lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Methuselah.
After Methuselah’s birth, Enoch walked with God for three hundred years, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
All the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.
Enoch walked with God, and he was not found, for God took him.
Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years, then became the father of Lamech.
Methuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years, then he died.
Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years, then became the father of a son.
He named him Noah, saying, “This one will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, caused by the ground which Yahweh has cursed.
Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
All the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, then he died.
Noah was five hundred years old, then Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
When men began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
Yahweh said, “My Spirit will not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; so his days will be one hundred twenty years.
Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.
But Noah found favor in Yahweh’s eyes.
This is the history of the generations of Noah: Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time.
Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
God said to Noah, “I will bring an end to all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them.
The length of the ship shall be three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
You shall make a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward.
You shall set the door of the ship in its side.
You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.
I, even I, do bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky.
Everything that is in the earth will die.
But I will establish my covenant with you.
You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.
Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort will come to you, to keep them alive.
Take with you of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for you, and for them.
Thus Noah did.
He did all that God commanded him.
Yahweh said to Noah, “Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation.
You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the male and his female.
Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him.
Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.
went by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah.
After the seven days, the floodwaters came on the earth.
In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and the sky’s windows were opened.
It rained on the earth forty days and forty nights.
In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth—the sons of Noah—and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship—
they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.
Pairs from all flesh with the breath of life in them went to Noah into the ship.
Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; then Yahweh shut him in.
The flood was forty days on the earth.
The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.
The waters rose, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.
The waters rose fifteen cubits higher, and the mountains were covered.
All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man.
All on the dry land, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died.
Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship.
The waters flooded the earth one hundred fifty days.
God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth.
The waters subsided.
The deep’s fountains and the sky’s windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained.
In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible.
At the end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made,
and he sent out a raven.
It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth.
So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth.
He waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; and she didn’t return to him anymore.
He saw that the surface of the ground was dried.
In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
God spoke to Noah, saying,
“Go out of the ship, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons’ wives with you.
Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.
Noah went out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him.
Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.
Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night will not cease.
God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky.
Every moving thing that lives will be food for you.
I will surely require your blood of your lives; at the hand of every animal I will require it.
Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.
God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,
“As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you,
and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.
I will establish my covenant with you: All flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood, neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth.
God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.
When I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,
and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.
God said to Noah, “This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.
The sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Ham is the father of Canaan.
Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.
Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father.
Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.
All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, and then he died.
The sons of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
The sons of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca.
The sons of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan.
Cush became the father of Nimrod.
He began to be a mighty one in the earth.
He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh.
Therefore it is said, “like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh”.
The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,
and Resen between Nineveh and the great city Calah.
Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,
the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,
the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites.
Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.
The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon—as you go toward Gerar—to Gaza—as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim—to Lasha.
The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
The sons of Aram were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
Shelah became the father of Eber.
His brother’s name was Joktan.
Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab.
All these were the sons of Joktan.
Their dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
These are the families of the sons of Noah, by their generations, according to their nations.
The nations divided from these in the earth after the flood.
The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
They said one to another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.
” They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.
Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.
Yahweh said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do.
Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.
This is the history of the generations of Shem.
Shem was one hundred years old and became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.
Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of sons and daughters.
Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.
Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of sons and daughters.
Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber:
and Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of sons and daughters.
Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg.
Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of sons and daughters.
Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu.
Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of sons and daughters.
Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug.
Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of sons and daughters.
Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor.
Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of sons and daughters.
Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.
Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of sons and daughters.
Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
Haran became the father of Lot.
Abram and Nahor took wives.
Sarai was barren.
Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife.
I will make of you a great nation.
All of the families of the earth will be blessed in you.
So Abram went, as Yahweh had spoken to him.
Lot went with him.
Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.
Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother’s son, all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten in Haran, and they went to go into the land of Canaan.
The Canaanite was then in the land.
Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your seed.
There he built an altar to Yahweh and called on Yahweh’s name.
Abram traveled, going on still toward the South.
There was a famine in the land.
Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.
When Abram had come into Egypt, Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she was your wife?
Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they brought him on the way with his wife and all that he had.
Abram went up out of Egypt: he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.
Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are relatives.
Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.
Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one from the other.
Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.
In the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim,
Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled.
In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
They returned, and came to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar.
against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.
Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and those who remained fled to the hills.
They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.
Now he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were allies of Abram.
The king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).
Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.
He blessed him, and said, “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:
Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,
After these things Yahweh’s word came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Don’t be afraid, Abram.
I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.
Abram said, “Lord Yahweh, what will you give me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”
Abram said, “Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.
Behold, Yahweh’s word came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir, but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir.
He believed in Yahweh; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.
He said to him, “I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.
He said, “Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?”
He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
He brought him all of these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn’t divide the birds.
The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
He said to Abram, “Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them.
They will afflict them four hundred years.
I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve.
It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:
the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
Sarai said to Abram, “See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing.
Please go in to my handmaid.
It may be that I will obtain children by her.
” Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
He went in to Hagar, and she conceived.
When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
Sarai said to Abram, “This wrong is your fault.
I gave my handmaid into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes.
Yahweh judge between me and you.
But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your hand.
Do to her whatever is good in your eyes.
” Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.
Yahweh’s angel found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain on the way to Shur.
He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s handmaid, where did you come from? Where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.
Yahweh’s angel said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands.
Yahweh’s angel said to her, “I will greatly multiply your seed, that they will not be numbered for multitude.
He will live opposite all of his brothers.
Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
When Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram, and said to him, “I am God Almighty.
Walk before me, and be blameless.
I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.
Neither will your name any more be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession.
I will be their God.
It will be a token of the covenant between me and you.
God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but her name will be Sarah.
I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her.
Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations.
Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you!”
But my covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year.
When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money; every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him.
Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised.
All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood opposite him.
When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart.
After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.
He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them.
They asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?” He said, “See, in the tent.
Yahweh said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Will I really bear a child, yet I am old?’
Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son.
Then Sarah denied, saying, “I didn’t laugh,” for she was afraid.
He said, “No, but you did laugh.
The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom.
Abraham went with them to see them on their way.
Yahweh said, “Will I hide from Abraham what I do,
For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.
I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me.
If not, I will know.
The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh.
Abraham drew near, and said, “Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?
What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?
May that be far from you.
Yahweh said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.
What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?” He said, “I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there.
He spoke to him yet again, and said, “What if there are forty found there?” He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.
He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak.
What if there are thirty found there?” He said, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
He said, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord.
He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more.
The two angels came to Sodom at evening.
” They said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.
He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.
He said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly.
See now, I have two virgin daughters.
Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you.
Only don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.
They said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge.
The men said to Lot, “Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:
for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.
Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city.
” But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.
Lot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord.
I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.
See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one.
The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.
He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.
But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.
He lived in a cave with his two daughters.
He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up.
Thus both of Lot’s daughters were with child by their father.
The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab.
Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.
” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
Now Abimelech had not come near her.
’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this.
Now therefore, restore the man’s wife.
For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live.
If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.
Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear.
The men were very scared.
Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!”
Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?”
Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you.
Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken.
Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him.
Sarah said, “God has made me laugh.
Everyone who hears will laugh with me.
The child grew, and was weaned.
Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
God said to Abraham, “Don’t let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your handmaid.
For from Isaac will your seed be called.
I will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid, because he is your seed.
The water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away.
For she said, “Don’t let me see the death of the child.
” She sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
God heard the voice of the boy.
Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand.
For I will make him a great nation.
God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water.
She went, filled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink.
God was with the boy, and he grew.
He lived in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.
He lived in the wilderness of Paran.
His mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.
Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son.
Abraham said, “I will swear.
Abimelech said, “I don’t know who has done this thing.
You didn’t tell me, neither did I hear of it, until today.
Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech.
Those two made a covenant.
Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean?”
He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.
So they made a covenant at Beersheba.
Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.
After these things, God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” He said, “Here I am.
Offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.
Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son.
He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.
On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.
Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, “My father?” He said, “Here I am, my son.
” He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”
Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.
Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.
Yahweh’s angel called to him out of the sky, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” He said, “Here I am.
He said, “Don’t lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him.
For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.
Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns.
Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.
that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore.
Your seed will possess the gate of his enemies.
All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your seed, because you have obeyed my voice.
After these things, it was told Abraham, saying, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor:
Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years.
Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.
Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,
“I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you.
Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
“Hear us, my lord.
You are a prince of God among us.
Bury your dead in the best of our tombs.
Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
He talked with them, saying, “If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if you will, please hear me.
I will give the price of the field.
Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.
Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
“My lord, listen to me.
What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead.
Abraham listened to Ephron.
Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants’ standard.
to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
Abraham was old, and well stricken in age.
Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.
Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh.
I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live.
But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
The servant said to him, “What if the woman isn’t willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?”
Abraham said to him, “Beware that you don’t bring my son there again.
Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, ‘I will give this land to your seed.
If the woman isn’t willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this oath to me.
Only you shall not bring my son there again.
The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.
Behold, I am standing by the spring of water.
The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,’ and she will say, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,’—let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac.
By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.
Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.
The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin, neither had any man known her.
The servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.
When she had done giving him drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they have done drinking.
She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.
She said moreover to him, “We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.
Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels.
Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.
” He said, “Speak on.
He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.
My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,
but you shall go to my father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.
I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’
You shall take a wife for my son of my relatives, and of my father’s house.
If they don’t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.
Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,”
and she will tell me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”—let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master’s son.
I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.
She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.
’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink.
I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.
’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.
If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing proceeds from Yahweh.
The servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah.
He said to them, “Don’t hinder me, since Yahweh has prospered my way.
They called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.
They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham’s servant, and his men.
They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, “Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them.
Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South.
Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel.
She said to the servant, “Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.
” She took her veil, and covered herself.
He loved her.
The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
The sons of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah.
All these were the children of Keturah.
He sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.
These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.
Abraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.
Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,
Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bore to Abraham.
These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.
Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.
Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren.
He was named Jacob.
Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison.
Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished.
” Therefore his name was called Edom.
He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way.
So Esau despised his birthright.
There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham.
Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.
Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you.
In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,
because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.
Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife.
Why did you say, ‘She is my sister?’” Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.
Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.
He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household.
Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go from us, for you are much mightier than we.
Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.
Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.
” He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, “I am the God of Abraham your father.
Don’t be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.
There Isaac’s servants dug a well.
Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?”
They said, “We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you.
We said, ‘Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you,
’ You are now the blessed of Yahweh.
They rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another.
Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
The same day, Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.
When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
He said, “See now, I am old.
I don’t know the day of my death.
Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison.
Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son.
Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,
‘Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my death.
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.
Go now to the flock, and get me from there two good young goats.
I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves.
You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.
Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son.
Only obey my voice, and go get them for me.
She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck.
She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
I have done what you asked me to do.
Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He said, “Because Yahweh your God gave me success.
Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.
So he blessed him.
He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He said, “I am.
His father Isaac said to him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said, “Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.
God give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine.
He said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times.
Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants.
With grain and new wine have I sustained him.
Isaac his father answered him, “Behold, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling, and of the dew of the sky from above.
Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand.
Then I will kill my brother Jacob.
The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah.
She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.
If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?”
Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples,
and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham.
Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,”
and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram.
Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn’t please Isaac, his father.
Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set.
He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.
He dreamed.
Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven.
Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
Behold, Yahweh stood above it, and said, “I am Yahweh, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac.
The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed.
Your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south.
In you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.
Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top.
Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on,
so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, and Yahweh will be my God,
then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God’s house.
Of all that you will give me I will surely give the tenth to you.
Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.
He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep lying there by it.
They rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well’s mouth in its place.
He said to them, “Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.
He said to them, “Is it well with him?” They said, “It is well.
See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.
Water the sheep, and go and feed them.
They said, “We can’t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth.
While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she kept them.
When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.
Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son.
” He lived with him for a month.
Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.
Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man.
They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.
Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.
In the morning, behold, it was Leah.
He said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”
Laban said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.
Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years.
Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week.
He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.
He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.
For she said, “Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction.
Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in God’s place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”
She said, “Behold, my maid Bilhah.
Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.
She gave him Bilhah her handmaid as wife, and Jacob went in to her.
Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.
Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son.
Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.
Rachel said, “With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed.
” She named him Naphtali.
When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.
She said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes, also?” Rachel said, “Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.
Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.
” He lay with her that night.
Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons.
” She named him Zebulun.
Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.
She named him Joseph, saying, “May Yahweh add another son to me.
When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.
He said, “Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.
He said, “What shall I give you?” Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything.
If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.
I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats.
This will be my hire.
Laban said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.
That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
He set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.
Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
They conceived when they came to drink.
The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted.
The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
He heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s.
Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,
and said to them, “I see the expression on your father’s face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.
Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn’t allow him to hurt me.
If he said this, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled.
If he said this, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore streaked.
Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock, and given them to me.
During mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.
He said, ‘Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.
I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me.
Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.
Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?
For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s.
Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.
Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,
Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.
Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.
Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?
Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn’t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;
and didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.
It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.
Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s house, but why have you stolen my gods?”
Jacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.
Anyone you find your gods with shall not live.
Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it.
” For Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen them.
Laban felt about all the tent, but didn’t find them.
She said to her father, “Don’t let my lord be angry that I can’t rise up before you; for I’m having my period.
Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.
“These twenty years I have been with you.
Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven’t eaten the rams of your flocks.
That which was torn of animals, I didn’t bring to you.
Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.
These twenty years I have been in your house.
I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.
Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty.
God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.
Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?
Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you.
Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
Laban said, “This heap is witness between me and you this day.
” Therefore it was named Galeed
and Mizpah, for he said, “Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.
If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.
Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.
May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.
” Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac.
Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread.
They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain.
Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them.
Laban departed and returned to his place.
Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: ‘This is what your servant, Jacob, says.
The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau.
Not only that, but he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.
Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed.
He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;
and he said, “If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.
Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,’
You said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which can’t be numbered because there are so many.
He lodged there that night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his brother:
two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.
He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.
He commanded the foremost, saying, “When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?’
Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant, Jacob’s.
It is a present sent to my lord, Esau.
Perhaps he will accept me.
So the present passed over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the camp.
He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.
Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.
When he saw that he didn’t prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled.
The man said, “Let me go, for the day breaks.
” Jacob said, “I won’t let you go, unless you bless me.
He said to him, “What is your name?” He said, “Jacob”.
” He said, “Why is it that you ask what my name is?” He blessed him there.
Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, he said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.
Therefore the children of Israel don’t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.
Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men.
He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids.
He put the handmaids and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.
Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept.
He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, “Who are these with you?” He said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.
Then the handmaids came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.
Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves.
After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.
Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.
Esau said, “Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.
Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
Esau said, “Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me.
” He said, “Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.
So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city.
Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him.
The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it.
Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter.
You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you.
Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it.
Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife.
The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,
Only on this condition will we consent to you.
If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;
The young man didn’t wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father.
Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,
“These men are peaceful with us.
For behold, the land is large enough for them.
Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised.
Won’t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let us give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.
All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away.
They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field,
Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
I am few in number.
They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.
They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth.
God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him.
God said to him, “Your name is Jacob.
” He named him Israel.
A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body.
The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your seed after you will I give the land.
God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone.
He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.
The same is the Pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.
While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Israel heard of it.
Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
The sons of Bilhah (Rachel’s handmaid): Dan and Naphtali.
The sons of Zilpah (Leah’s handmaid): Gad and Asher.
These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.
Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners.
The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years.
Isaac gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days.
Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him.
Now this is the history of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom).
Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon, the Hittite; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite;
and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth.
Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz.
These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, with his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.
For their substance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land of their travels couldn’t bear them because of their livestock.
This is the history of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir:
these are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, the wife of Esau; and Reuel, the son of Basemath, the wife of Esau.
The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau’s son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek.
These are the sons of Adah, Esau’s wife.
These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.
These were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife.
These were the sons of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,
chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek: these are the chiefs who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah.
These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.
These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan.
These are the chiefs who came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.
These are the children of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
These are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah.
These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
These are the children of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
These are the chiefs who came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,
chief Dishon, chief Ezer, and chief Dishan: these are the chiefs who came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.
Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zerah of Bozrah, reigned in his place.
Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.
The name of his city was Avith.
Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place.
Shaul died, and Baal Hanan, the son of Achbor reigned in his place.
Baal Hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place.
The name of his city was Pau.
His wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
These are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau, according to their families, after their places, and by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,
chief Magdiel, and chief Iram.
These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession.
Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colors.
Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more.
He said to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:
His brothers said to him, “Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion over us?” They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words.
He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.
His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind.
His brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
Israel said to Joseph, “Aren’t your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them.
He said, “I am looking for my brothers.
Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock.
The man said, “They have left here, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.
’” Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.
They said one to another, “Behold, this dreamer comes.
Come now therefore, and let’s kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, ‘An evil animal has devoured him.
’ We will see what will become of his dreams.
Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, “Let’s not take his life.
Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood.
When Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;
and they took him, and threw him into the pit.
The pit was empty.
There was no water in it.
They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?
Come, and let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh.
” His brothers listened to him.
Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver.
They brought Joseph into Egypt.
Reuben returned to the pit; and saw that Joseph wasn’t in the pit; and he tore his clothes.
He returned to his brothers, and said, “The child is no more; and I, where will I go?”
They took Joseph’s coat, and killed a male goat, and dipped the coat in the blood.
They took the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, “We have found this.
He recognized it, and said, “It is my son’s coat.
All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted.
” His father wept for him.
At that time, Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up seed to your brother.
The thing which he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and he killed him also.
Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up”; for he said, “Lest he also die, like his brothers.
After many days, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died.
Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.
It was told Tamar, saying, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.
He turned to her by the way, and said, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he didn’t know that she was his daughter-in-law.
She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”
He said, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.
” She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?”
He said, “What pledge will I give you?” She said, “Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.
” He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.
She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
Then he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?” They said, “There has been no prostitute here.
He returned to Judah, and said, “I haven’t found her; and also the men of the place said, ‘There has been no prostitute here.
Judah said, “Let her keep it, lest we be shamed.
Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, because I didn’t give her to Shelah, my son.
” He knew her again no more.
In the time of her travail, behold, twins were in her womb.
From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, Yahweh blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake.
Joseph was well-built and handsome.
After these things, his master’s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.
He isn’t greater in this house than I, neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife.
He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.
She spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,
and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.
When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your servant did to me,” his wrath was kindled.
The keeper of the prison didn’t look after anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper.
After these things, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt.
Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad.
He asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?”
” Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me.
The chief cup bearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me,
and in the vine were three branches.
It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes.
Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.
You will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cup bearer.
But remember me when it will be well with you, and please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.
For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.
In the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.
On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cup bearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
He restored the chief cup bearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand;
but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Yet the chief cup bearer didn’t remember Joseph, but forgot him.
At the end of two full years, Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river.
Behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass.
The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle.
So Pharaoh awoke.
He slept and dreamed a second time: and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good.
Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears.
Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon.
I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.
Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It isn’t in me.
God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle,
and when they had eaten them up, it couldn’t be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning.
So I awoke.
I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good:
and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain.
Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one.
What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.
The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years.
The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.
Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.
There will arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt.
and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous.
“Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.
The food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine.
Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?”
Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.
and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had.
Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife.
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt.
Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly.
To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.
Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, “For”, he said, “God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.
The name of the second, he called Ephraim: “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.
The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end.
There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.
Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?”
Joseph was the governor over the land.
It was he who sold to all the people of the land.
Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth.
Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him.
Your servants are not spies.
He said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”
Joseph said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’
He put them all together into custody for three days.
Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God.
If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.
Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.
Therefore this distress has come upon us.
Reuben answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child,’ and you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.
They didn’t know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.
He turned himself away from them, and wept.
Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way.
They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.
Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
He said to his brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”
They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying,
“The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.
As they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack.
When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
Jacob, their father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away.
Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.
He said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left.
If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.
The famine was severe in the land.
When they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.
Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.
Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?”
They said, “The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ We just answered his questions.
Is there any way we could know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down?’”
Judah said to Israel, his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.
If I don’t bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever,
Perhaps it was an oversight.
Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man.
May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin.
If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon.
The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house.
They came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,
and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food.
The man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet.
He gave their donkeys fodder.
When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to him to the earth.
Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep.
He entered into his room, and wept there.
He washed his face, and came out.
He controlled himself, and said, “Serve the meal.
They drank, and were merry with him.
He commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in his sack’s mouth.
” He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.
They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!
Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan.
How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord’s house?
With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.
He said, “Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found will be my slave; and you will be blameless.
Then they hurried, and each man took his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack.
He searched, beginning with the eldest, and ending at the youngest.
The cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there.
The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.
Then Judah came near to him, and said, “Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and don’t let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.
My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’
You said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.
You said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.
When we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
Our father said, ‘Go again, buy us a little food.
We said, ‘We can’t go down.
Your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons:
If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.
Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; since his life is bound up in the boy’s life;
it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die.
Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol.
Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, my lord’s slave; and let the boy go up with his brothers.
For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn’t with me?—lest I see the evil that will come on my father.
Then Joseph couldn’t control himself before all those who stood before him, and he cried, “Cause everyone to go out from me!” No one else stood with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
Now don’t be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.
For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.
So now it wasn’t you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Come down to me.
Don’t wait.
There I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have.
Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them.
After that his brothers talked with him.
Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this.
Also, don’t concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all of the land of Egypt is yours.
The sons of Israel did so.
Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.
He sent the following to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.
So he sent his brothers away, and they departed.
He said to them, “See that you don’t quarrel on the way.
They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father.
They told him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Joseph my son is still alive.
I will go and see him before I die.
God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, “Jacob, Jacob!” He said, “Here I am.
He said, “I am God, the God of your father.
Don’t be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation.
I will go down with you into Egypt.
Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
These are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.
The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron.
The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his daughter Dinah.
All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three.
The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister.
The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.
The son of Dan: Hushim.
The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who were his direct descendants, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were sixty-six.
The sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls.
Joseph prepared his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen.
He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.
Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father’s house, “I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him, ‘My brothers, and my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say, ‘What is your occupation?’
From among his brothers he took five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.
Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” They said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.
They said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks.
For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan.
Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.
The land of Egypt is before you.
Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land.
Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many are the days of the years of your life?”
Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years.
Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh.
Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won’t be desolate.
So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh’s.
Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh.
Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth.
Only the land of the priests alone didn’t become Pharaoh’s.
Israel bowed himself on the bed’s head.
” He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
Someone told Jacob, and said, “Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,” and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.
Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.
Your issue, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours.
As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).
Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?”
Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.
” He said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.
Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn’t see.
He brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your seed also.
He blessed Joseph, and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,
When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him.
Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.
His father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know.
He also will become a people, and he also will be great.
Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.
Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
Jacob called to his sons, and said: “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come.
Binding his foal to the vine, his donkey’s colt to the choice vine; he has washed his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes.
his robes in the blood of grapes.
“Dan will judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
even by the God of your father, who will help you; by the Almighty, who will bless you, with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.
He instructed them, and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people.
Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place.
There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there I buried Leah:
Joseph fell on his father’s face, wept on him, and kissed him.
Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel.
Forty days were fulfilled for him, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm.
The Egyptians wept for him for seventy days.
Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.
” Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.
Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt,
all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house.
There went up with him both chariots and horsemen.
It was a very great company.
When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.
Joseph returned into Egypt—he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to him.
They sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father commanded before he died, saying,
His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, “Behold, we are your servants.
“Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, to the land which I give to them, even to the children of Israel.
I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will tread on, as I told Moses.
From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.
“Be strong and courageous; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.
Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
“Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.
Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,
“Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, saying, ‘Yahweh your God gives you rest, and will give you this land.
They answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses.
Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, including Jericho.
” They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and slept there.
The king of Jericho was told, “Behold, men of the children of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land.
The king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered into your house; for they have come to spy out all the land.
Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake them.
The men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords: and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.
Before they had laid down, she came up to them on the roof;
For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
The men said to her, “Our life for yours, if you don’t talk about this business of ours; and it shall be, when Yahweh gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.
Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived on the wall.
She said to them, “Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned.
Afterward, you may go your way.
The men said to her, “We will be guiltless of this your oath which you have made us to swear.
Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him.
But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear.
She said, “According to your words, so be it.
They went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned.
The pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but didn’t find them.
Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain, passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had happened to them.
They said to Joshua, “Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands all the land.
Moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us.
Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel.
They lodged there before they passed over.
After three days, the officers went through the midst of the camp;
and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place, and follow it.
Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure.
Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people.
” They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.
You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.
Joshua said to the children of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your God.
Joshua said, “Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite out from before you.
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.
Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.
It shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in one heap.
and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest),
Then the people passed over right against Jericho.
The priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation had passed completely over the Jordan.
When all the nation had completely passed over the Jordan, Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
“Take twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
Joshua said to them, “Pass over before the ark of Yahweh your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you pick up a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;
then you shall tell them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.
These stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.
The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and passed over.
When all the people had completely passed over, Yahweh’s ark passed over, with the priests, in the presence of the people.
The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them.
About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war passed over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of Jericho.
On that day, Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
“Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.
Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, “Come up out of the Jordan!”
When the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up to the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks, as before.
The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.
Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, in Gilgal.
He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean?’
Then you shall let your children know, saying, ‘Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh, that it is mighty; that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.
At that time, Yahweh said to Joshua, “Make flint knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
This is the reason Joshua circumcised: all the people who came out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
Yahweh swore to them that he wouldn’t let them see the land which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Their children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.
They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.
The children of Israel didn’t have manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand.
Joshua went to him, and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our adversaries?”
He said, “No; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh’s army.
The prince of Yahweh’s army said to Joshua, “Take your shoes off of your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy.
No one went out, and no one came in.
Yahweh said to Joshua, “Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the mighty men of valor.
All your men of war shall march around the city, going around the city once.
You shall do this six days.
Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark.
On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
They said to the people, “Advance! March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh’s ark.
It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Yahweh advanced, and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.
The trumpets sounded as they went.
Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up Yahweh’s ark.
The rear guard came after Yahweh’s ark.
The second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp.
They did this six days.
On the seventh day, they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times.
They shall come into Yahweh’s treasury.
So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets.
They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.
Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house, and bring out from there the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.
They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it.
Joshua commanded them with an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed is the man before Yahweh, who rises up and builds this city Jericho.
But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things.
Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against the children of Israel.
” The men went up and spied out Ai.
They returned to Joshua, and said to him, “Don’t let all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai.
So about three thousand men of the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai.
Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before Yahweh’s ark until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.
Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!
Yahweh said to Joshua, “Get up! Why are you fallen on your face like that?
Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them.
I will not be with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.
“Get up! Sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, “There is a devoted thing in your midst, Israel.
You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you.
It shall be that the tribe which Yahweh selects shall come near by families.
The family which Yahweh selects shall come near by households.
So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes.
The tribe of Judah was selected.
He brought near the family of Judah; and he selected the family of the Zerahites.
He brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was selected.
He brought near his household man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.
Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and make confession to him.
When I saw among the plunder a beautiful Babylonian robe, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them and took them.
So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent.
Behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.
Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.
Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you this day.
” All Israel stoned him with stones, and they burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.
Set an ambush for the city behind it.
So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai.
Joshua chose thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them out by night.
I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city.
It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.
’ So we will flee before them,
and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.
Joshua rose up early in the morning, mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
All the people, even the men of war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai.
Now there was a valley between him and Ai.
Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
All the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them.
They pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
There was not a man left in Ai or Beth El who didn’t go out after Israel.
They left the city open, and pursued Israel.
Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.
” Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it.
When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and killed the men of Ai.
They captured the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua.
When Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, all Israel returned to Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword.
For Joshua didn’t draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day.
Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,
They offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh, and sacrificed peace offerings.
He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.
There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua didn’t read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them.
they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
All the bread of their provision was dry and moldy.
They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country.
The men of Israel said to the Hivites, “What if you live among us.
How could we make a covenant with you?”
They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.
” Joshua said to them, “Who are you? Where do you come from?”
They said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of Yahweh your God; for we have heard of his fame, all that he did in Egypt,
and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and tell them, “We are your servants.
Now make a covenant with us.
These wine skins, which we filled, were new; and behold, they are torn.
These our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey.
The men sampled their provisions, and didn’t ask counsel from the mouth of Yahweh.
The children of Israel didn’t strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel.
All the congregation murmured against the princes.
The princes said to them, “Let them live, so they became wood cutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them.
Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ when you live among us?
Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you will never fail to be slaves, both wood cutters and drawers of water for the house of my God.
They answered Joshua, and said, “Because your servants were certainly told how Yahweh your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you.
Do to us as it seems good and right to you to do.
He did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they didn’t kill them.
they were very afraid, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.
Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
“Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, “Don’t abandon your servants! Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country have gathered together against us.
So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
He went up from Gilgal all night.
Yahweh confused them before Israel, and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah and to Makkedah.
As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth Horon, Yahweh hurled down great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died.
The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies.
There was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought for Israel.
Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace.
When they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.
” They came near, and put their feet on their necks.
Afterward Joshua struck them, put them to death, and hanged them on five trees.
They were hanging on the trees until the evening.
He did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.
Yahweh delivered it also, with its king, into the hand of Israel.
He did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it fought against it.
They took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword.
Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.
He left no one remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls who were in it.
Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it.
As he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.
So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings.
Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time, because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,
to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
They went out, they and all their armies with them, many people, even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots.
You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.
So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell on them.
Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword: for Hazor used to be the head of all those kingdoms.
Joshua captured all the cities of those kings, with their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded.
As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua.
So Joshua captured all that land, the hill country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;
from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon.
He took all their kings, struck them, and put them to death.
Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon.
They took all in battle.
For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.
The land had rest from war.
and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir.
Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;
in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;
the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
the king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty-one.
“This is the land that still remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath;
all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allocate it to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them:
from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;
and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;
Nevertheless the children of Israel didn’t drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.
Only he gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi.
The offerings of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance, as he spoke to him.
Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families.
Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;
Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,
Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar in the mount of the valley,
Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, Beth Jeshimoth,
all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
The children of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the soothsayer, with the sword, among the rest of their slain.
The border of the children of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan.
This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and its villages.
Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad, according to their families.
Their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah;
This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and its villages.
These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.
But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance.
Yahweh, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spoke to them.
by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their livestock and for their property.
The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses, and they divided the land.
Then the children of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal.
Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.
I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land.
I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
Nevertheless, my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God.
Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land where you walked shall be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have wholly followed Yahweh my God.
“Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness.
Now, behold, I am eighty-five years old, today.
Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and great and fortified cities.
It may be that Yahweh will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh spoke.
Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because he wholly followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.
The lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.
Their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looks southward;
and it passed along to Azmon, went out at the brook of Egypt; and the border ended at the sea.
This shall be your south border.
The east border was the Salt Sea, even to the end of the Jordan.
The border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan.
The border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh, and ended at En Rogel.
The border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the farthest part of the valley of Rephaim northward.
The border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (the same is Kiriath Jearim);
The west border was to the shore of the great sea.
This is the border of the children of Judah according to their families.
Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
He went up against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.
Caleb said, “He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
She got off of her donkey, and Caleb said, “What do you want?”
Because you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.
” He gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
The farthest cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,
Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,
Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,
Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth Hezron (the same is Hazor),

Baalah, Iim, Ezem,
Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah,
Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,
Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon.
All the cities are twenty-nine, with their villages.
In the lowland, Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah,
Zanoah, En Gannim, Tappuah, Enam,
Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,
Shaaraim, Adithaim and Gederah (or Gederothaim); fourteen cities with their villages.

“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Assign the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by Moses,
If the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the man slayer into his hand; because he struck his neighbor unintentionally, and didn’t hate him before.
Then the man slayer shall return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city he fled from.
They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
Beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.

They possessed it, and lived in it.

Then Joshua called the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
and said to them, “You have kept all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you.
You have not left your brothers these many days to this day, but have performed the duty of the commandment of Yahweh your God.
Now Yahweh your God has given rest to your brothers, as he spoke to them.
Therefore now return and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan.
Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.
So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went to their tents.
Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan; but to the other half gave Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward.
Divide the plunder of your enemies with your brothers.
The children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they owned, according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
When they came to the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look at.
When the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.
The children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers’ house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were everyone of them head of their fathers’ houses among the thousands of Israel.
They came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,
that you must turn away this day from following Yahweh? It will be, since you rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel,
For Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad.
“Therefore we said, ‘Let’s now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice;
“Therefore we said, ‘It shall be, when they tell us or our generations this in time to come, that we shall say, “Behold the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you.
“Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh, and turn away this day from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle!”
When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.
Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, “Today we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us, because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh.
The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad lived.
The children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar “A Witness Between Us that Yahweh is God.
Yahweh your God will thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight.
You shall possess their land, as Yahweh your God spoke to you.
“Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left;
that you not come among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves to them;
One man of you shall chase a thousand; for it is Yahweh your God who fights for you, as he spoke to you.
Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love Yahweh your God.
“Behold, today I am going the way of all the earth.
Not one thing has failed of it.
Then Yahweh’s anger will be kindled against you, and you will perish quickly from off the good land which he has given to you.
Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, for their heads, for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods.
I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
“‘I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in its midst: and afterward I brought you out.
I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and you came to the sea.
The Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the Red Sea.
You possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
So I delivered you out of his hand.
“‘You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho.
The men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.
I gave you a land whereon you had not labored, and cities which you didn’t build, and you live in them.
You eat of vineyards and olive groves which you didn’t plant.
The people answered, “Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh, to serve other gods;
for it is Yahweh our God who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed.
Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land.
Therefore we also will serve Yahweh; for he is our God.
If you forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after he has done you good.
The people said to Joshua, “No; but we will serve Yahweh.
Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Yahweh yourselves, to serve him.
” They said, “We are witnesses.
“Now therefore put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
The people said to Joshua, “We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his voice.
So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all Yahweh’s words which he spoke to us.
It shall be therefore a witness against you, lest you deny your God.
So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
After these things, Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred and ten years old.
They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of Yahweh, that he had worked for Israel.
They became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
After the death of Joshua, the children of Israel asked of Yahweh, saying, “Who should go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?”
” So Simeon went with him.
Judah went up, and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand.
They struck ten thousand men in Bezek.
They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and they fought against him; and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, took it, struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
After that, the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland.
Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba); and they struck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
(Now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.
Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it, so he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
When she came, she got him to ask her father for a field.
The children of the Kenite, Moses’ brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.
Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Ashkelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.
They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken: and he drove out there the three sons of Anak.
The house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel; and Yahweh was with them.
The watchers saw a man come out of the city, and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.
The man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.
Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns, nor Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
Zebulun didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them, and became subject to forced labor.
Asher didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;
but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
Naphtali didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labor.
The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country; for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;
but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labor.
He said, “I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you:
and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.
’ But you have not listened to my voice: why have you done this?
Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.
When Yahweh’s angel spoke these words to all the children of Israel, the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
They called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to Yahweh.
Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
The people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel.
Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.
They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
Also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, who didn’t know Yahweh, nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel.
The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and served the Baals;
and they abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them: and they provoked Yahweh to anger.
Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of raiders who plundered them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
Wherever they went out, the hand of Yahweh was against them for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them: and they were very distressed.
Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them.
But when the judge was dead, they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they didn’t cease from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.
Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Israel; and he said, “Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;
I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to prove Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
The Spirit of Yahweh came on him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.
The land had rest forty years.
The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
He gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.
The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.
Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh.
When he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people who bore the tribute.
Ehud said, “I have a message from God to you.
” He arose out of his seat.
Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:
and the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn’t draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.
Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, “Surely he is covering his feet in the upper room.
Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.
He said to them, “Follow me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.
” They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn’t allow any man to pass over.
They struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man.
After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also saved Israel.
Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, “Hasn’t Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded, ‘Go and draw to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.
Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.
She said, “I will surely go with you: nevertheless, the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.
” Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.
Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.
But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don’t be afraid.
” He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.
” She opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.
So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
“Speak, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit on rich carpets, and you who walk by the way.
you who sit on rich carpets,
Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, there they will rehearse the righteous acts of Yahweh, the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.
“Through the window she looked out, and cried: Sisera’s mother looked through the lattice.
The hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried to Yahweh.
and I said to you, “I am Yahweh your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.
Yahweh’s angel came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.
Yahweh’s angel appeared to him, and said to him, “Yahweh is with you, you mighty man of valor!”
Gideon said to him, “Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, ‘Didn’t Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?’ But now Yahweh has cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.
Please don’t go away, until I come to you, and bring out my present, and lay it before you.
” He did so.
Gideon saw that he was Yahweh’s angel; and Gideon said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh! Because I have seen Yahweh’s angel face to face!”
That same night, Yahweh said to him, “Take your father’s bull, even the second bull seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is by it;
Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Yahweh had spoken to him.
Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
But the Spirit of Yahweh came on Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together after him.
He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,
Let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.
Yahweh said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.
Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.
’” Twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.
Yahweh said to Gideon, “The people are still too many.
Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there.
It shall be, that of whom I tell you, ‘This shall go with you,’ the same shall go with you; and of whoever I tell you, ‘This shall not go with you,’ the same shall not go.
So he brought down the people to the water; and Yahweh said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set him by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.
The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.
Let all the other people go, each to his own place.
So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
That same night, Yahweh said to him, “Arise, go down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.
But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp:
and you shall hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp.
The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude.
It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, “Arise; for Yahweh has delivered the army of Midian into your hand!”
He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.
They each stood in his place around the camp; and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put them to flight.
They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every man’s sword against his fellow, and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.
The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.
Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan!” So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.
Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.
He said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.
The princes of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?”
Gideon said, “Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, “When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.
He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother.
He said to Jether his firstborn, “Get up, and kill them!” But the youth didn’t draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth.
” Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels’ necks.
Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, both you, and your son, and your son’s son also; for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian.
The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels’ necks.
The land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body; for he had many wives.
His concubine who was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.
Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
The children of Israel didn’t remember Yahweh their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;
neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.
Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother’s brothers, and spoke with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,
He went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:
God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.
When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
Now therefore, go up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field:
Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Behold, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains.
” Zebul said to him, “You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
Then Zebul said to him, “Now where is your mouth, that you said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Isn’t this the people that you have despised? Please go out now and fight with them.
Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.
On the next day, the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field, and struck them.
Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and killed the people who were therein: and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.
Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
But there was a strong tower within the city, and there fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower.
Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, and broke his skull.
’ His young man thrust him through, and he died.
He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
After him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years.
Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and served the Baals, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they abandoned Yahweh, and didn’t serve him.
Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.
They troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year.
For eighteen years, they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was very distressed.
Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen.
Let them save you in the time of your distress!”
The children of Israel said to Yahweh, “We have sinned: do you to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us, please, this day.
They put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Yahweh; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
The children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.
The people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another, “What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a prostitute: and Gilead became the father of Jephthah.
Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.
It was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob;
and they said to Jephthah, “Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Didn’t you hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?”
The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Yahweh shall be witness between us; surely according to your word so will we do.
Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh in Mizpah.
The king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan: now therefore restore that territory again peaceably.
but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;
then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let me pass through your land;’ but the king of Edom didn’t listen.
In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel stayed in Kadesh.
They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.
So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?
Won’t you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.
Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?
While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn’t you recover them within that time?
I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me.
Yahweh, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
However the king of the children of Ammon didn’t listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
Then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.
Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, “If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
then it shall be, that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.
So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.
He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter.
Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
She was a virgin.
It was a custom in Israel,
that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
The men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said to Jephthah, “Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didn’t call us to go with you? We will burn your house around you with fire!”
When I saw that you didn’t save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand.
Why then have you come up to me this day, to fight against me?”
Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.
The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites.
At that time, forty-two thousand of Ephraim fell.
Jephthah judged Israel six years.
Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was buried in the cities of Gilead.
After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
He had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons.
He judged Israel seven years.
Ibzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem.
After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.
Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
He had forty sons and thirty sons’ sons, who rode on seventy donkey colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and didn’t bear.
Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink, and don’t eat any unclean thing:
Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and said, “Oh, Lord, please let the man of God whom you did send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born.
The woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said to him, “Behold, the man has appeared to me, who came to me that day.
Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to the woman?” He said, “I am.
Manoah said, “Now let your words happen.
Yahweh’s angel said to Manoah, “Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.
Manoah said to Yahweh’s angel, “Please, let us detain you, that we may make a young goat ready for you.
Yahweh’s angel said to Manoah, “Though you detain me, I won’t eat of your bread; and if you will prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.
” For Manoah didn’t know that he was Yahweh’s angel.
Yahweh’s angel said to him, “Why do you ask about my name, since it is wonderful?”
So Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh.
But Yahweh’s angel didn’t appear to Manoah or to his wife any more.
Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
The woman bore a son, and named him Samson: and the child grew, and Yahweh blessed him.
The Spirit of Yahweh began to move him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
Then his father and his mother said to him, “Is there never a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?” Samson said to his father, “Get her for me; for she pleases me well.
But his father and his mother didn’t know that it was of Yahweh; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines.
Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and behold, a young lion roared against him.
He went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.
After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
His father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.
Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a riddle now.
If you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing;
but if you can’t declare it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.
” They said to him, “Tell us your riddle, that we may hear it.
” They couldn’t in three days declare the riddle.
On the seventh day, they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father’s house with fire.
Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, “You just hate me, and don’t love me.
” He said to her, “Behold, I haven’t told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?”
“If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer,
But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat; and he said, “I will go in to my wife into the room.
” But her father wouldn’t allow him to go in.
Her father said, “I most certainly thought that you had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion.
Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between every two tails.
When he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.
Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” They said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife, and given her to his companion.
” The Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.
Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, “Don’t you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?” He said to them, “As they did to me, so have I done to them.
” They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.
He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put out his hand, and took it, and struck a thousand men with it.
But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it.
When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: therefore its name was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi, to this day.
He judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a prostitute, and went in to her.
It came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
The lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, “Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.
Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies, and what you might be bound to afflict you.
Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.
Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
So his strength was not known.
Delilah said to Samson, “Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now please tell me with which you might be bound.
He said to her, “If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.
He broke them off his arms like a thread.
” He said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web.
She said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies.
When she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, his soul was troubled to death.
” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hand.
” But he didn’t know that Yahweh had departed from him.
However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.
The lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, “Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people who were therein.
Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father.
There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
” His mother said, “Blessed be my son of Yahweh.
The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he lived there.
The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to live where he could find a place, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he traveled.
Micah said to him, “Where did you come from?” He said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I am looking for a place to live.
” So the Levite went in.
The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.
Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
Then Micah said, “Now know I that Yahweh will do good to me, since I have a Levite to my priest.
When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside there, and said to him, “Who brought you here? What do you do in this place? What do you have here?”
The priest said to them, “Go in peace.
Do you stand still? Don’t be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.
They passed there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
They turned aside there, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.
The six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them.
There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob.
They built the city, and lived therein.
They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however the name of the city was Laish at the first.
His concubine played the prostitute against him, and went away from him to her father’s house to Bethlehem Judah, and was there the space of four months.
His father-in-law, the young lady’s father, retained him; and he stayed with him three days: so they ate and drink, and lodged there.
On the fourth day, they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart.
The young lady’s father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way.
The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.
He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the young lady’s father said, “Please strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines”; and they both ate.
When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, “Please come and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
His master said to him, “We won’t turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.
He said to his servant, “Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?”
He said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim.
I am going to Yahweh’s house; and there is no man who takes me into his house.
The old man said, “Peace be to you; howsoever let all your wants lie on me; only don’t lodge in the street.
So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder; and they washed their feet, and ate and drink.
Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine.
I will bring them out now.
Her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
Then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and went to his place.
Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah.
The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword.
(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.
) The children of Israel said, “Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?”
The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, “I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
They thought to have slain me, and they forced my concubine, and she is dead.
Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.
But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;
and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.
So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What wickedness is this that is happen among you?
” But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel.
The children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed; everyone could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss.
The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew sword: all these were men of war.
The children of Israel arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God; and they said, “Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin?” Yahweh said, “Judah first.
The children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.
The children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty-two thousand men.
Benjamin went out against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
The children of Israel asked of Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
The children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
The children of Benjamin said, “They are struck down before us, as at the first.
” But the children of Israel said, “Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.
There came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe; but they didn’t know that evil was close on them.
Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men: all these drew the sword.
The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil had come on them.
There fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.
They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck of them two thousand men.
So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were men of valor.
But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months.
On the next day, the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
They said, “What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah?” Behold, no one came from Jabesh Gilead to the camp to the assembly.
For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there.
The congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.
They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
The people grieved for Benjamin, because that Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
However we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, ‘Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.
They said, “Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,
and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each man catch his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
They went and returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them.

Aaron spoke to Moses, “Behold, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before Yahweh; and such things as these have happened to me.

“‘Only the firstborn among animals, which is made a firstborn to Yahweh, no man may dedicate it; whether an ox or sheep.
If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it; or if it isn’t redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
“‘Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to Yahweh.
It is holy to Yahweh.
All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh.
He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it.
These are the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
“Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, every male, one by one;
With you there shall be a man of every tribe; everyone head of his fathers’ house.
These are the names of the men who shall stand with you: Of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur.

Moses and Aaron took these men who are mentioned by name.
As Yahweh commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.

even all those who were numbered were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.
But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.
For Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
“Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, neither shall you take a census of them among the children of Israel;
but appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it.
They shall carry the tabernacle, and all its furnishings; and they shall take care of it, and shall encamp around it.
When the tabernacle is to move, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set it up.
According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they did.

But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards, and so they set out, everyone by their families, according to their fathers’ houses.
Now this is the history of the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Yahweh spoke with Moses in Mount Sinai.
These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office in the presence of Aaron their father.
They shall keep all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting, and the obligations of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.
You shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons.
They are wholly given to him on the behalf of the children of Israel.
You shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep their priesthood.
“Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn who open the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine:
for all the firstborn are mine.
They shall be mine.
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
Moses numbered them according to Yahweh’s word, as he was commanded.

Those who encamp before the tabernacle eastward, in front of the Tent of Meeting toward the sunrise, shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the requirements of the sanctuary for the duty of the children of Israel.
All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of Yahweh, by their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty-two thousand.
Moses numbered, as Yahweh commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.
All the firstborn males according to the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those who were numbered of them, were twenty-two thousand two hundred seventy-three.
“Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites instead of their livestock; and the Levites shall be mine.
For the redemption of the two hundred seventy-three of the firstborn of the children of Israel, who exceed the number of the Levites,
and you shall give the money, with which their remainder is redeemed, to Aaron and to his sons.
Moses took the redemption money from those who exceeded the number of those who were redeemed by the Levites;
from the firstborn of the children of Israel he took the money, one thousand three hundred sixty-five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:
and Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and to his sons, according to Yahweh’s word, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
“Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers’ houses,

“This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the Tent of Meeting, the most holy things.
“On the table of show bread they shall spread a blue cloth, and put on it the dishes, the spoons, the bowls, and the cups with which to pour out; and the continual bread shall be on it.

“Don’t cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites;
but thus do to them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach to the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them everyone to his service and to his burden;
but they shall not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment, lest they die.

and the pillars of the court around it, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service: and by name you shall appoint the instruments of the duty of their burden.
This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service, in the Tent of Meeting, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families, and by their fathers’ houses,

Those who were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred fifty.

even those who were numbered of them, were eight thousand five hundred eighty.
According to the commandment of Yahweh they were numbered by Moses, everyone according to his service, and according to his burden.
Thus were they numbered by him, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
“Command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper, and everyone who has an issue, and whoever is unclean by the dead.
The children of Israel did so, and put them outside of the camp; as Yahweh spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel.
But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to Yahweh shall be the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, by which atonement shall be made for him.
Every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present to the priest, shall be his.
“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: ‘If any man’s wife goes astray, and is unfaithful to him,
then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring her offering for her: the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal.
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water.
But if you have gone astray, being under your husband, and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with you besides your husband:”
“‘The priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness.
The priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the meal offering before Yahweh, and bring it to the altar.
If the woman isn’t defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
“‘This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goes astray, and is defiled;
or when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then he shall set the woman before Yahweh, and the priest shall execute on her all this law.
He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of fermented drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.
“‘All the days that he separates himself to Yahweh he shall not go near a dead body.
He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his separation to God is on his head.
All the days of his separation he is holy to Yahweh.
“‘If any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing.
On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting.
“‘This is the law of the Nazirite: when the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door of the Tent of Meeting,
and he shall offer his offering to Yahweh, one male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb a year old without defect for a sin offering, and one ram without defect for peace offerings,
The priest shall offer also its meal offering, and its drink offering.
The Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings.
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh.
This is holy for the priest, together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered.
“Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘This is how you shall bless the children of Israel.
‘Yahweh bless you, and keep you.
Yahweh make his face to shine on you, and be gracious to you.
“So they shall put my name on the children of Israel; and I will bless them.
and they brought their offering before Yahweh, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle.
“Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.
Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to their service:
But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them; they carried it on their shoulders.
one young bull, one ram, one male lamb a year old, for a burnt offering;
one male goat for a sin offering;
and for the sacrifice of peace offerings, two head of cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs a year old.

and all the cattle for the sacrifice of peace offerings twenty-four bulls, the rams sixty, the male goats sixty, the male lambs a year old sixty.
This was the dedication of the altar, after it was anointed.
“Speak to Aaron, and tell him, ‘When you light the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lamp stand.
This was the workmanship of the lamp stand, beaten work of gold.
From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work: according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses, so he made the lamp stand.
“Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.
You shall do this to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.
and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Yahweh.
You shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh.
Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.
“After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting: and you shall cleanse them, and offer them as a wave offering.
I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel.
“This is that which belongs to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the Tent of Meeting;
and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting on the work, and shall serve no more,
but shall minister with their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to perform the duty, and shall do no service.
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
“Moreover let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season.
On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep it in its appointed season—according to all its statutes, and according to all its ordinances, you shall keep it.
Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should keep the Passover.
They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai.
According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did.
There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.
Those men said to him, “We are unclean because of the dead body of a man.
Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among the children of Israel?”
Moses answered them, “Wait, that I may hear what Yahweh will command concerning you.
“Say to the children of Israel, ‘If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep the Passover to Yahweh.
“‘If a foreigner lives among you, and desires to keep the Passover to Yahweh; according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance, so shall he do.
You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner, and for him who is born in the land.
The cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel traveled; and in the place where the cloud remained, there the children of Israel encamped.
Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled: or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled.
At the commandment of Yahweh they encamped, and at the commandment of Yahweh they traveled.
You shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.
When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward.
They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
“The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets.
This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.
Then you will be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you will be saved from your enemies.
In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony.
The children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran.
Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army.
Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar.
Eliab the son of Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun.
The tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, went forward.
Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai was over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon.
Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad.
Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army.
Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh.

Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army.
Pagiel the son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher.
Ahira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali.
Thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies; and they went forward.
Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are journeying to the place of which Yahweh said, ‘I will give it to you.
He said, “Don’t leave us, please; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.
It shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that whatever good Yahweh does to us, we will do the same to you.
They set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days’ journey.
The people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh.
The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire abated.
The name of that place was called Taberah, because Yahweh’s fire burnt among them.
We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;
The manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.
Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.
Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and Yahweh’s anger was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.
Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have you treated with your servant so badly? Why haven’t I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?
Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them out, that you should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers?’
Where could I get meat to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.
I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you.
I will come down and talk with you there.
” Therefore Yahweh will give you flesh, and you will eat.
but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because that you have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, “Why did we come out of Egypt?”’”
Moses said, “The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, ‘I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
Yahweh said to Moses, “Has Yahweh’s hand grown short? Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not.
Moses went out, and told the people Yahweh’s words; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent.
Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders.
When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.
But two men remained in the camp.
The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested on them; and they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.
Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
The people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails.
He who gathered least gathered ten homers; and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp.
The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.
From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth; and they stayed at Hazeroth.
Now the man Moses was very humble, above all the men who were on the surface of the earth.
Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, “You three come out to the Tent of Meeting!” The three of them came out.
If there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh, will make myself known to him in a vision.
I will speak with him in a dream.
My servant Moses is not so.
He is faithful in all my house.
With him, I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see Yahweh’s form.
Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?”
Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, please don’t count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.
Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.
Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “Heal her, God, I beg you!”
Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days, and the people didn’t travel until Miriam was brought in again.
Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
“Send men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel.
Of every tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man, every one a prince among them.
Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Yahweh.
These were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.
Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.
Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land.
Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country.
See the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;
and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;
They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there.
(Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.
They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs.
They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
They went and came to Moses, to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to all the congregation.
They told him, and said, “We came to the land where you sent us.
Surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
However the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large.
Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.
Amalek dwells in the land of the South.
The Hittite, the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwell in the hill country.
The Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along the side of the Jordan.
Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it!”
But the men who went up with him said, “We aren’t able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature.
All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
They said one to another, “Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes.
They spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.
If Yahweh delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey.
Only don’t rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us.
Yahweh’s glory appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel.
They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.
They have heard that you Yahweh are in the midst of this people; for you Yahweh are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.
Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,
Now please let the power of the Lord be great, according as you have spoken, saying,
surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised me see it.
His seed shall possess it.
Since the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley, tomorrow turn, and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
“How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
Tell them, ‘As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you.
Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,
surely you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
I, Yahweh, have spoken.
The men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,
even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Yahweh.
Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.
Don’t go up, for Yahweh isn’t among you; that you not be struck down before your enemies.
But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain.
Nevertheless, the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and Moses, didn’t depart out of the camp.
Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down, even to Hormah.
You shall prepare wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of a hin, with the burnt offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
“‘Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil;
and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.
When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to Yahweh;
then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil:
and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.
“‘All who are native-born shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.
If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh; as you do, so he shall do.
For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner, a statute forever throughout your generations.
As you are, so shall the foreigner be before Yahweh.
One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you.
“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land where I bring you,
Of the first of your dough, you shall give to Yahweh a wave offering throughout your generations.
“‘When you shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which Yahweh has spoken to Moses,
even all that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses, from the day that Yahweh gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;
The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering before Yahweh, for their error.
All the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, as well as the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them; for with regard to all the people, it was done unwittingly.
“‘If one person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering.
The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs, when he sins unwittingly before Yahweh, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.
You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is native-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them.
“‘But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, the same blasphemes Yahweh.
That soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Because he has despised Yahweh’s word, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off.
His iniquity shall be on him.
Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.
They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
Yahweh said to Moses, “The man shall surely be put to death.
All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they should make themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue:
that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.
Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took some men.
It shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses, he shall be holy.
You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!”
Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi!
Is it a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of Yahweh’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;
Korah assembled all the congregation opposite them to the door of the Tent of Meeting.
Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the congregation.
“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!”
“Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!’”
He spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!”
So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side.
Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.
Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind.
If these men die the common death of all men, or if they experience what all men experience, then Yahweh hasn’t sent me.
But if Yahweh makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up, with all that belong to them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then you shall understand that these men have despised Yahweh.
As he made an end of speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split apart.
The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, all of Korah’s men, and all their goods.
So they, and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol.
The earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.
All Israel that were around them fled at their cry; for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up!”
“Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire away from the camp; for they are holy,
even the censers of these sinners against their own lives.
Let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before Yahweh.
Therefore they are holy.
But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed Yahweh’s people!”
Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.
“Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!” They fell on their faces.
Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly.
Behold, the plague has begun among the people.
He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and the plague was stopped.
“Speak to the children of Israel, and take rods from them, one for each fathers’ house, of all their princes according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods.
Write each man’s name on his rod.
You shall write Aaron’s name on the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers’ houses.
You shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud.
I will make the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you, cease from me.
Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, even twelve rods.
Aaron’s rod was among their rods.
Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the tent of the testimony.
On the next day, Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, Aaron’s rod for the house of Levi had sprouted, budded, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.
Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all the children of Israel.
They looked, and each man took his rod.
As Yahweh commanded him, so he did.
They shall keep your commands, and the duty of all the Tent; only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor you.
They shall be joined to you, and keep the responsibility of the Tent of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent.
A stranger shall not come near to you.
Behold, I myself have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel.
They are a gift to you, dedicated to Yahweh, to do the service of the Tent of Meeting.
Yahweh spoke to Aaron, “Behold, I myself have given you the command of my wave offerings, even all the holy things of the children of Israel.
You shall eat of it like the most holy things.
Every male shall eat of it.
“This is yours, too: the wave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children of Israel.
I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a portion forever.
Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.
“I have given to you all the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give to Yahweh.
The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to Yahweh, shall be yours.
“Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours.
Yahweh said to Aaron, “You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion among them.
I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.
“To the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the Tent of Meeting.
Henceforth the children of Israel shall not come near the Tent of Meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.
But the Levites shall do the service of the Tent of Meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity.
It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
Among the children of Israel, they shall have no inheritance.
For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a wave offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance.
Therefore I have said to them, ‘Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
Your wave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the wine press.
Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and of it you shall give Yahweh’s wave offering to Aaron the priest.
Out of all your gifts, you shall offer every wave offering of Yahweh, of all its best, even the holy part of it out of it.
You may eat it anywhere, you and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the Tent of Meeting.
You shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it its best.
You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her outside of the camp, and one shall kill her before his face.
Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times.
One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn.
The priest shall take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.
He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.
It shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them, for a statute forever.
“He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.
His uncleanness is yet on him.
“This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
“Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
A clean person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, on all the vessels, on the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave.
The clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day.
On the seventh day, he shall purify him.
He shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening.
But the man who shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh.
It shall be a perpetual statute to them.
“Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until evening.
The children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month.
Miriam died there, and was buried there.
There was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and fell on their faces.
Yahweh’s glory appeared to them.
“Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it pour out its water.
Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, “Hear now, you rebels! Shall we bring water out of this rock for you?”
Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice, and water came out abundantly.
The congregation and their livestock drank.
These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with Yahweh, and he was sanctified in them.
Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: “Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the travail that has happened to us;
how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time.
When we cried to Yahweh, he heard our voice, sent an angel, and brought us out of Egypt.
We will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border.
Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you.
The children of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway; and if we drink your water, I and my livestock, then I will give its price.
Only let me, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.
He said, “You shall not pass through.
” Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.
They traveled from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.
Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,
and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son.
Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son.
Aaron died there on the top of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, “If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities.
The name of the place was called Hormah.
They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom The soul of the people was very discouraged because of the journey.
The people spoke against God, and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes this light bread.
” Moses prayed for the people.
which the nobles of the people dug,
and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.
Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
He fought against Israel.
Moses sent to spy out Jazer.
They took its towns, and drove out the Amorites who were there.
They turned and went up by the way of Bashan.
The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.
Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me.
Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me.
Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.
” The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
God came to Balaam, and said, “Who are these men with you?”
Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me,
Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.
Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land; for Yahweh refuses to permit me to go with you.
The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.
Balak again sent princes, more, and more honorable than they.
They came to Balaam, and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me,
for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do.
Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.
Balaam answered the servants of Balak, “If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.
Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may know what Yahweh will speak to me more.
God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.
Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.
Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field.
Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.
Then Yahweh’s angel stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall.
He struck her again.
Yahweh’s angel went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she lay down under Balaam.
Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.
Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”
Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you.
Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.
Yahweh’s angel said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me.
The donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times.
Yahweh’s angel said to Balaam, “Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak.
” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you.
Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth.
Balaam said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go.
He answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth?”
Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, where you may see them.
Balak said to him, “What has Yahweh spoken?”
When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel, he didn’t go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him.
Therefore now flee you to your place! I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh has kept you back from honor.
Balaam said to Balak, “Didn’t I also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying,
‘If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond Yahweh’s word, to do either good or bad of my own mind.
Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab;
for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods.
The people ate and bowed down to their gods.
Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
He went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body.
It shall be to him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.
The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur.
He was head of the people of a fathers’ house in Midian.
“Harass the Midianites, and strike them,
After the plague, Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
“Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ houses, all who are able to go out to war in Israel.
Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer.
Kohath became the father of Amram.
The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt.
To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph.
They stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the Tent of Meeting, saying,
“Our father died in the wilderness.
He had no sons.
Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give to us a possession among the brothers of our father.
Moses brought their cause before Yahweh.
“The daughters of Zelophehad speak right.
You shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brothers.
You shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.
You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.
If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.
If his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it.
This shall be a statute and ordinance for the children of Israel, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered;
because in the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, to honor me as holy at the waters before their eyes.
Moses spoke to Yahweh, saying,
Set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and commission him in their sight.
He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh.
At his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.
He laid his hands on him, and commissioned him, as Yahweh spoke by Moses.
You shall tell them, ‘This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to Yahweh: male lambs a year old without defect, two day by day, for a continual burnt offering.
You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and you shall offer the other lamb at evening;
It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
Its drink offering shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb.
You shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to Yahweh in the holy place.
“‘In the beginnings of your months, you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls, and one ram, seven male lambs a year old without defect;
and a tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering to every lamb; for a burnt offering of a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
This is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
One male goat for a sin offering to Yahweh; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering, and its drink offering.
“‘In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Yahweh’s Passover.
In the first day shall be a holy convocation.
You shall do no regular work;
but you shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls, and one ram, and seven male lambs a year old; they shall be to you without defect;
In this way you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.
It shall be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering, and its drink offering.
On the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation.
but you shall offer a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old;
and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth parts for each bull, two tenth parts for the one ram,
a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;
one male goat, to make atonement for you.
Besides the continual burnt offering, and its meal offering, you shall offer them and their drink offerings.
See that they are without defect.
You shall offer a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh: one young bull, one ram, seven male lambs a year old without defect;
and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth parts for the bull, two tenth parts for the ram,
and one tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;
and one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you;
and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth parts for the bull, two tenth parts for the one ram,
“‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have a holy convocation.
You shall keep a feast to Yahweh seven days.
You shall offer a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh: thirteen young bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs a year old; all without defect;
and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth parts for every bull of the thirteen bulls, two tenth parts for each ram of the two rams,
“‘On the second day you shall offer twelve young bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs a year old without defect;
“‘On the fourth day ten bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs a year old without defect;
“‘On the sixth day eight bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs a year old without defect;
and one male goat for a sin offering; besides the continual burnt offering, its meal offering, and the drink offerings of it.
“‘On the seventh day seven bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs a year old without defect;
“‘On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly: you shall do no regular work;
but you shall offer a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh: one bull, one ram, seven male lambs a year old without defect;
their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bull, for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the ordinance:
Moses told the children of Israel according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses.
But if her father forbids her in the day that he hears, none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, shall stand.
Yahweh will forgive her, because her father has forbidden her.
“But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, everything with which she has bound her soul, shall stand against her.
But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand.
He has established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
But if he shall make them null and void after that he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.
These are the statutes which Yahweh commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father’s house.
“Avenge the children of Israel for the Midianites.
Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.
Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Yahweh’s vengeance on Midian.
Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, you shall send to the war.
So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian.
They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.
The children of Israel took the women of Midian captive with their little ones; and all their livestock, all their flocks, and all their goods, they took as plunder.
All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.
They took all the captives, and all the plunder, both of man and of animal.
They brought the captives, and the prey, and the plunder, to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.
Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went out to meet them outside of the camp.
Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.
Moses said to them, “Have you saved all the women alive?
Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of Yahweh.
Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him.
But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
As to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood, you shall purify yourselves.
Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, “This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded Moses:
however the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
All that doesn’t withstand the fire you shall make to go through the water.
You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean.
Afterward you shall come into the camp.
“Count the plunder that was taken, both of man and of animal, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the congregation;
and divide the plunder into two parts: between the men skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation.
Levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred; of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks.
Take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for Yahweh’s wave offering.
Of the children of Israel’s half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the livestock, and give them to the Levites, who perform the duty of Yahweh’s tabernacle.
Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
Now the plunder, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,
and seventy-two thousand head of cattle,
and sixty-one thousand donkeys,
and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known man by lying with him.
The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep:
and Yahweh’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five.
The cattle were thirty-six thousand; of which Yahweh’s tribute was seventy-two.
The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred; of which Yahweh’s tribute was sixty-one.
Moses gave the tribute, which was Yahweh’s wave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
Of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided off from the men who fought
(now the congregation’s half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,
and thirty-six thousand head of cattle,
and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,
and sixteen thousand persons),
even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them to the Levites, who performed the duty of Yahweh’s tabernacle; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses.
Moses and Eleazar the priest took their gold, even all worked jewels.
All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels.
The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh.
Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock.
When they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for livestock;
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,
“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,
the land which Yahweh struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock.
They said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession.
Don’t bring us over the Jordan.
Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Yahweh has given them?
For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them.
Yahweh’s anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,
‘Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me,
except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have followed Yahweh completely.
“Behold, you have risen up in your fathers’ place, an increase of sinful men, to increase the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel.
For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all of these people.
They came near to him, and said, “We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones;
but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place.
For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.
Moses said to them, “If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war,
and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless towards Yahweh, and towards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh.
“But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh; and be sure your sin will find you out.
The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, “Your servants will do as my lord commands.
Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;
but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before Yahweh to battle, as my lord says.
So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’ households of the tribes of the children of Israel.
Moses said to them, “If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle, before Yahweh, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession;
but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, “As Yahweh has said to your servants, so will we do.
The children of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
Atrothshophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.
The children of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their names being changed), and Sibmah.
These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Yahweh.
These are their journeys according to their goings out.

Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died in Mount Hor.

They traveled from the mountains of Abarim, and encamped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
They encamped by the Jordan, from Beth Jeshimoth even to Abel Shittim in the plains of Moab.
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, “When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, destroy all their stone idols, destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places.
You shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for I have given the land to you to possess it.
Wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his.
You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.
“But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those you let remain of them will be as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides, and they will harass you in the land in which you dwell.
It shall happen that as I thought to do to them, so will I do to you.
“Command the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to its borders),
The border shall turn about from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and it shall end at the sea.
“‘For the western border, you shall have the great sea and its border.
This shall be your west border.
“‘This shall be your north border: from the great sea you shall mark out for yourselves Mount Hor.
Then the border shall go to Ziphron, and it shall end at Hazar Enan.
This shall be your north border.
“‘You shall mark out your east border from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
The border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain.
The border shall go down, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward.
The border shall go down to the Jordan, and end at the Salt Sea.
for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers’ houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers’ houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance.
The two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise.
“These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
You shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.
These are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
Of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

“The suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits around it.
You shall measure outside of the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the middle.
This shall be the suburbs of their cities.
“The cities which you shall give to the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the man slayer to flee to.
Besides them you shall give forty-two cities.
All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities together with their suburbs.
Everyone according to his inheritance which he inherits shall give some of his cities to the Levites.
“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
then you shall appoint for yourselves cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the man slayer who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.
The cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger, that the man slayer not die, until he stands before the congregation for judgment.
The cities which you shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.
You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan.
“‘But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer.
The murderer shall surely be put to death.
If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer.
Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer.
The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death.
or in hostility struck him with his hand, so that he died, he who struck him shall surely be put to death.
He is a murderer.
or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;
The congregation shall deliver the man slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, where he had fled.
He shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
“‘But if the man slayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, where he flees,
because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest.
“‘These things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
“‘Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
“‘You shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
“‘So you shall not pollute the land in which you are; for blood pollutes the land.
No atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him who shed it.
The heads of the fathers’ households of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel.
If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong.
So will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
The daughters of Zelophehad did as Yahweh commanded Moses:
for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father’s brothers’ sons.
They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph.
These are the commandments and the ordinances which Yahweh commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
In the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land.
The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah.
They came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.
Mahlon and Chilion both died, and the woman was bereaved of her two children and of her husband.
Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.
She went out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
” Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
Why do you want to go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
Go back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband.
If I should say, ‘I have hope,’ if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;
She said, “Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people, and to her god.
Follow your sister-in-law.
where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried.
Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death part you and me.
When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.
So they two went until they came to Bethlehem.
When they had come to Bethlehem, all the city was excited about them, and they asked, “Is this Naomi?”
She said to them, “Don’t call me Naomi.
Call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty; why do you call me Naomi, since Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?”
So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
’ So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little in the house.
Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter.
Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens.
Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them.
Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?”
Boaz answered her, “It has fully been shown me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn’t know before.
May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.
” She sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left some of it.
Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.
So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.
Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “Blessed be he of Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.
” Naomi said to her, “The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.
Ruth the Moabitess said, “Yes, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.
Now isn’t Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.
When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain.
She came softly, uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
At midnight, the man was startled and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.
He said, “Who are you?” She answered, “I am Ruth your handmaid.
